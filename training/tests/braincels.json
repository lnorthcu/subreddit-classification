Now my government is hunting me on charges of sedition. All because I tried to set up my own country within a country. \n\nBut there is good news!. The revolution will live! Incels will one day have a home of their own! A place way where you will not be judged by the attractiveness of your face but rather the content of your memes. My soliders are many. They will carry out my orders. Wait and watch with joviality. Your day of freedom is fast approaching. Long live the incelution and love live Incelopolis.",

I usually relieve this stress by the end of the day by fapping a bit, but the downside is that the next day im not as stressed and usually end up being more high inhib and a pushover.

My current bf is 6'3 but I didn't even notice because he was sitting down in his pics on tinder and wouldn't have even known unless I'd happened to see his bio as I was left swiping. His height didn't matter and still doesn't. I'd love him just as much if he was only 6'0.It's about what's inside! Go out there, be confident! Women love a confident guy!

My current bf is 6'3 but I didn't even notice because he was sitting down in his pics on tinder and wouldn't have even known unless I'd happened to see his bio as I was left swiping. His height didn't matter and still doesn't. I'd love him just as much if he was only 6'0.It's about what's inside! Go out there, be confident! Women love a confident guy! Look at Chris Hemsworth, or Jason Momoa, women love them because they're confident!",

The best option IMO is to try and salvage what little happiness you can get out of this life and try to cope and enjoy the little things as long as possible.

I made this account to avoid being identified with my other (I’ve got some friends that follow me on there). I’ve tried to ignore it but for some reason I’m really into incels. I’ve never found them physically attractive but I love the idea of being dehumanized and treated/looked at as subhuman. Anyone interested PM me.",

Well, because women who enjoy fucking attractive men left and right are the rich people of the dating world.\n\nBut on the other side, they usually have little marketable skills, get useless degrees and end up working at Starbucks with a Gender Studies background.\n\nIn the end?

They adopt a mindset where everybody should get an equal piece of the pie and that rich people have no reason to be, because you don't need to live in a $2 million mansion and drive a lambo.\n\nWhich is fine, I guess, unless you also believe in a winner-takes-all mindset in the dating market at the same time.\n\nWhy am I saying that? Well, because women who enjoy fucking attractive men left and right are the rich people of the dating world.\n\nBut on the other side, they usually have little marketable skills, get useless degrees and end up working at Starbucks with a Gender Studies background.\n\nIn the end? They love capitalism when it benefits them, but cry when it doesn't.",

        "selftext": "Western civilisation now has one huge problem: there are not enough taxpayers to fund the welfare system in the future. Due to females voting to steal money from men via the govt so they don't need husbands, and female hypergamy forcing men out of the breeding market, there will not be enough working men to keep the western economy going. The birthrate has stalled so that there will be no future workers to replace those retiring and enough men have already checked out to add further strain. Trying to replace these men with female workers worsens the birthrate problem.\n\nImmigration has been the proposed solution to this, importing new male workers to keep this system going. However these immigrants are replacing the native population and inserting their forms of culture/civilisation. As more and more asians go to Australia, China is asserting more control there. As more hispanics go to America, southern US is looking more and more like Mexico. And more and more immigrants must flow in, indefinitely, or the system goes bust.\n\nSo either western civilisation as we know it collapses and restarts, or it is replaced with new peoples with their cultures. There's no other solution. The elites want to keep their wealth so they have gone with the immigration bandaid solution, and whilst that may keep them going for a while, it creates a very precarious future for their lineage. There are other possibilities, like technology, dictatorship, etc. but all of those things require a new system to replace the old, meaning western liberal democratic civilisation is over.\n\nSo basically the point I'm making is that the liberal democratic system that allows women to vote has already failed... I see a lot of people speculating about how it will collapse in the future, well that is undeniable reality today. The system has already reached a complete dead end and is finished. Women are just blithely partying and enjoying their greed as the ship goes down from 1960 to - , just as I'm sure they somewhat did in western Rome from 400 when their influence was already massively diminishing and the writing was on the wall to 476.

He was visibly uncomfortable throughout the entire interaction, but it didn't matter because he had hunter eyes and strong jawline. When they parted ways, one of the girls yelled, \"please text me when you get home.\"\n\nIn all my years I've never had a single person say that to me. Not even my so-called friends. No one ever gave a fuck about my safety when I was out doing reckless shit. I overdosed a while back and my siblings didn't even visit me in the hospital.

In all honesty im conflicted by the fact that you are loners, but yet, hold beliefs that I feel are all true and accurate, most of the things (that I have read) you talk about (even though the groupthink assholes and beta bitchmales put it on your poor experience with feemales) are just fact, no matter the cost (people will use this post to attack my non mainstream opinions) I want you to know (in my opinion as a non indoctrinated free thinker) you are neither delusional, nor wrong. The smarter women are also mysoginists. They see the true situation of their sex's way of being. Im posting this to try and make some of you understand that violence is not the way to go. Use the internet and its anon advantages into ridiculing the current structure and \"movements\" of these so called feminists. Create fake profiles (im sure these tactics are currently being used against you too), chadfish stupid women into sending you money cause \"you're going through a hard time\" or have them go long distances to end up dissapointed, post incredibly (but credible) idiotic messages on the behalf of them. Just take actions that show the true state of affairs of these leashed up and dominated cucks. I have little respect for groupthink fucks (reddit is full of them). Research OPSec and anon methods, use the time that you gain by not bothering with the opposite sex constructively (even if in the end it might not change anything, although I assure you it might), violence will only hurt your situation, it will make these so called \"good people\", \"progressives\" and virtue signallers to bully you more. Not to mention the fact that govt will jump on this train since stokimg fear within the general population is the name of the game for current governments everywhere. Spread the word, renounce violence, use the weapons and tactics of social engineering against the status quo as it is being used against you. Women, gays and trans are part of the plan to dominate and subjugate the males of the western world, its not conspiracy, its social manipulation to take the balls away from men and our generation is the first one to be have this tactic / weapon used against it. We may lack the cohesion to win this battle, but we must damn well fight it to the end even if we will lose. Victory to the enemy must not be given freely. I hope this message will reach enough of you to change something for the better. Name of the game is and will always be covert action and manipulation, not violence. Remember that.",

I was dressed in one of my nice shirts, so I looked at them and smiled. They looked at me, but they didn’t even deign to smile back. They just looked away as if I was a fool. As I drove away I became very infuriated. It was such an insult. This was the way all girls treated me, and I was sick and tired of it. In a rage, I made a U-turn, pulled up to their bus stop and splashed my Starbucks latte all over them. I felt a feeling a spiteful satisfaction as I saw it stain their jeans. I then quickly speeded away before they could catch my license plate number. How dare those girls snub me in such a fashion! How dare they insult me so! I raged to myself repeatedly. They deserved the punishment I gave them. It was such a pity that my latte wasn’t hot enough to burn them. Those girls deserved to be dumped in boiling water for the crime of not giving me the attention and adoration I so rightfully deserve! \n\nThis incident soured my first week of college, but for the sake of all of my hopes and dreams, I tried to forget about it.",
