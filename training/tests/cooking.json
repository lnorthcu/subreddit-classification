        "selftext": "Okay y'all just a general note. \n\nI have lived away from my family a long time, but recently moved back home.  We are loving being near but I have noticed something that I never did before.  My grandmother and mother are considered 'great cooks' within the family. Having been away, distance wise, during all of my 20's I have learned to cook on my own and started  to find it a bit laughable when my mama is in the kitchen making something 'homemade'.  I realized, she is just mixing boxes of processed foods together and calling it homemade.. nothing is ever 'homemade! \n\nFor example, when I make soup I make homemade broth, chop my veggies, spice up my soup. When my mama makes soup, it is canned veggies, packaged broth dumped in, a package of soup spices mixed in. Everyone raves what an amazing cook she is..\n\nAnother example, making spaghetti .. we make homemade pasta sauce and tomato paste,, chop fresh veggies, add beef .. along with a homemade noddle. Never thought twice about it. Just the way our household does it.. Mama take a can of sauce, dumps it into a pan. \n\nLet me be clear, no way is better or worse, I just am taken back by the fact that this type of cooking is considered homemade ! To me, it is similar to heating up a microwave dinner! Nothing is fresh, or actually handcrafted. \n\nAnyone else have a similar experience?!?!",

            "selftext": "Okay y'all just a general note. \n\nI have lived away from my family a long time, but recently moved back home.  We are loving being near but I have noticed something that I never did before.  My grandmother and mother are considered 'great cooks' within the family. Having been away, distance wise, during all of my 20's I have learned to cook on my own and started  to find it a bit laughable when my mama is in the kitchen making something 'homemade'.  I realized, she is just mixing boxes of processed foods together and calling it homemade.. nothing is ever 'homemade! \n\nFor example, when I make soup I make homemade broth, chop my veggies, spice up my soup. When my mama makes soup, it is canned veggies, packaged broth dumped in, a package of soup spices mixed in. Everyone raves what an amazing cook she is..\n\nAnother example, making spaghetti .. we make homemade pasta sauce and tomato paste,, chop fresh veggies, add beef .. along with a homemade noddle. Never thought twice about it. Just the way our household does it.. Mama take a can of sauce, dumps it into a pan. \n\nLet me be clear, no way is better or worse, I just am taken back by the fact that this type of cooking is considered homemade ! To me, it is similar to heating up a microwave dinner! Nothing is fresh, or actually handcrafted. \n\nAnyone else have a similar experience?!?!",

I am so super excited and also a little nervous, but luckily the pressure isn’t too high since Christmas Eve for us is just immediate family (husband, parents, siblings). Curious to know what y’all will be serving. Below is my tentative menu.\n\n**Appetizer:** Cranberry Brie bites OR charcuterie board\n**Main course:** Either prime rib or beef tenderloin, garlic buttered green beans with slivered almonds, mashed potatoes &amp; gravy, home made Mac &amp; cheese, rolls/bread. May possibly also add a roasted vegetable blend (Brussels sprouts, carrots, broccolini, sweet potato) but I have some picky family members and not sure if its worth the added hassle.\n**Dessert:** TBD, will probably pick something up from a local bakery because I only have so much time to cook. Thinking either cheesecake or pecan pie. Will also have tons of cookies as we are having a Christmas bake-a-thon the Sunday prior. Hehe.\n\nI’m racking my brain trying to figure out when and how to prepare my food. We will be spending the morning/early afternoon with my husbands family on Christmas Eve day.  There will only be about a three hour gap between being at my MIL’s house and when I plan on having my family over. My initial plan was to cook Thursday night (christmas eve eve, lol), refrigerate it then reheat in the oven evening of. However, I don’t think prime rib or beef tenderloin will hold up great after refrigeration and reheating (someone with experience please let me know). Also, I know there will be leftovers I’d want to eat but I heard its a no-no to refrigerate and reheat twice (again, please let me know in the comments if that’s true or not). \n\nThe other idea was just to get everything cut up, prepared, measured, and set up and just go into a rage of cooking as soon as I get home from my MIL, but that sounds.. stressful.. but do-able.

I need some help from experienced bulk cooks out there. \n  \nI have a nice 12 qt., thick bottomed, stock pot that should be big enough for this. The plan so far is to cube the meat, braise it, then cook the onions and garlic, deglaze, and then start the stew with whatever ingredients I end up using. I am wondering if someone could give me a rundown on how to make a proper stew with pork. What kind of liquids should I use and in what amounts to give it that stew texture without turning it into a soup? I don't really want to just follow a recipe, because I want to learn how to actually put something like this together on my own, but maybe a good recipe that I could use as a base would be a good idea?  \n  \nIf anyone has any other idea about what I could do with this monster cut of meat let me know. I also thought about making some kind of green chili with it.  \n  \nAlso, I plan on freezing the leftovers, so any tips on things that freeze well and things that don't would be helpful. I know I have heard that potatoes don't freeze well at all. The large batch of beef chili I made a couple months ago froze really well in gallon freezer bags, but I think I will get some plastic tubs for this. Filling those freezer bags was a giant pain.",

I am wondering if someone could give me a rundown on how to make a proper stew with pork. What kind of liquids should I use and in what amounts to give it that stew texture without turning it into a soup? I don't really want to just follow a recipe, because I want to learn how to actually put something like this together on my own, but maybe a good recipe that I could use as a base would be a good idea?  \n  \nIf anyone has any other idea about what I could do with this monster cut of meat let me know. I also thought about making some kind of green chili with it.  \n  \nAlso, I plan on freezing the leftovers, so any tips on things that freeze well and things that don't would be helpful. I know I have heard that potatoes don't freeze well at all. The large batch of beef chili I made a couple months ago froze really well in gallon freezer bags, but I think I will get some plastic tubs for this. Filling those freezer bags was a giant pain.",

        "selftext": "Hi all!  I made an attempt at making bread for the first time today.  I started yesterday morning using a recipe I found online for simple bread.  3 1/4 cups of flour, 2 teaspoons of yeast, 2 teaspoons of salt, whisked, then added 1.5 cups of room temperature water, all of this according to the recipe.  I mixed it up and noticed it was very sticky, more than  it looked in the video, but I elected to just roll with it.  I let it sit on the counter, as instructed.  The recipe said 2-3 hours, but I did about an 1 and 15 minutes as the dough had visibly doubled in size.  I then put in my fridge.\n\n\nThis morning I took it out (about 18 hrs after it went in), shaped it into two loaves as instructed, covered and let rest for 45 minutes.  Then baked it at 475 for 25ish minutes.  Baked 5 or so minutes longer at 400 because it wasn't brown.  The bread at that point still wasn't very brown, but the crust was hard and tapping it sounded hollow, so I took it out.\n\n\nThe bread is good.  It tastes good, and the crust isn't soft or anything.  But it's not brown at all.  How do I get that nice brown crust?",

I have made some pretty tasty stuffed mushrooms before; my basic recipe is the minced buttered sauteed stems, plus minced onion or leek and celery, sauteed, plus some toasted pulverized nuts, and a good cheese, finely grated, Mix, season with s/p and maybe some cayenne or what have you. Meanwhile caps have have been tossed.with lots of oil, salt, garlic, pepper, left to sit awhile, then slightly baked. Pile the mixture into the caps, with nice craggy little mounds. Bake till nicely browned.\n\nHere's my question: what can I season this mixture with or add to it to really make the mushroom flavor pop? I'm doing criminis as a base; should I add a few shitakes or another mushroom to the mixture? Nix the celery? I've also considered using thyme, rosemary, oregano, fennel, chili flakes, and sage in various combinations. Are there some really good herbs tomuse with mushrooms that I'm overlooking? A technique I should employ?\n\nAlthough I'm open to adding sausage or meat, I have passed over most recipes online because I want mushrooms to be the star here, not crabmeat or chorizo or what have you.\n\nI'm fairly experienced and cook professionally (so these have to be Good as they're for the restaurant party lol)",

        "selftext": "Mandelbrot is the Jewish equivalent of biscotti, except it's better. I made it for years with walnuts. 5 yrs ago I switched to dried fruit when I passed a kidney stone and the doctor said \"no nuts for you\". Nuts, dried fruit, chocolate chips and broken Whoppers are all good. However; I love cherries.\nI do everything by hand. I use a Danish dough whisk, stiff silicone spatula and two large bowls. Set out 3 lg eggs to warm up. →dry ingredients: whisk 3 cups AP flour, ¼tsp salt and 1 tsp baking powder together in one bowl. →wet bowl: whisk 1 cup white sugar with ⅞ cup of canola oil. Add one egg at a time. Add 1tsp/½ T of extract. I use either vanilla or orange. I also add a couple packets of True Orange if I'm using dried cranberries. Add your dry ingredients into the wet stuff a bit at a time. Once it's Incorporated, use a spatula to mix in a cup of whatever you're putting in it.\nCover with Saran and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours. I often make the batter in the morning and bake cookies after dinner.\nI use a large lipless cookie sheet and cover it with parchment paper. PREHEAT OVEN TO 350° Divide the dough in four. Roll them in your hands. I then place them on the parchment and shmoodgie them to reach from end to end across the width of the sheet. I've cleaned out spice containers. I have sugar in one and cinnamon in another. I sprinkle the tops of the logs/breads before baking them for 25 minutes. Remove them when the 25 minutes are up.\nTurn off the oven and crack open the door. Let them cool for 10 minutes. Once cooled, carefully slide a spatula under them to free them from the parchment paper. Slide the nearest log onto a cutting board. Cut them about 1\" wide. Put them back onto the sheet on their sides. Preheat oven to 250°.\nBake them again for 20 minutes then flip them all over to the other side and put them back in for another 20 minutes. After that, turn all the cookies upside down and put them back into the cooling oven. This cures the cookies. This last step does two critical things. 1)It dries out the cookies so they could last up to a month. 2)It transforms them from tasting good to being \"OMG, these are delicious!\"",

            "selftext": "Mandelbrot is the Jewish equivalent of biscotti, except it's better. I made it for years with walnuts. 5 yrs ago I switched to dried fruit when I passed a kidney stone and the doctor said \"no nuts for you\". Nuts, dried fruit, chocolate chips and broken Whoppers are all good. However; I love cherries.\nI do everything by hand. I use a Danish dough whisk, stiff silicone spatula and two large bowls. Set out 3 lg eggs to warm up. →dry ingredients: whisk 3 cups AP flour, ¼tsp salt and 1 tsp baking powder together in one bowl. →wet bowl: whisk 1 cup white sugar with ⅞ cup of canola oil. Add one egg at a time. Add 1tsp/½ T of extract. I use either vanilla or orange. I also add a couple packets of True Orange if I'm using dried cranberries. Add your dry ingredients into the wet stuff a bit at a time. Once it's Incorporated, use a spatula to mix in a cup of whatever you're putting in it.\nCover with Saran and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours. I often make the batter in the morning and bake cookies after dinner.\nI use a large lipless cookie sheet and cover it with parchment paper. PREHEAT OVEN TO 350° Divide the dough in four. Roll them in your hands. I then place them on the parchment and shmoodgie them to reach from end to end across the width of the sheet. I've cleaned out spice containers. I have sugar in one and cinnamon in another. I sprinkle the tops of the logs/breads before baking them for 25 minutes. Remove them when the 25 minutes are up.\nTurn off the oven and crack open the door. Let them cool for 10 minutes. Once cooled, carefully slide a spatula under them to free them from the parchment paper. Slide the nearest log onto a cutting board. Cut them about 1\" wide. Put them back onto the sheet on their sides. Preheat oven to 250°.\nBake them again for 20 minutes then flip them all over to the other side and put them back in for another 20 minutes. After that, turn all the cookies upside down and put them back into the cooling oven. This cures the cookies. This last step does two critical things. 1)It dries out the cookies so they could last up to a month. 2)It transforms them from tasting good to being \"OMG, these are delicious!\"",

        "selftext": "Okay guys, I just gotta say I am a very casual cooker. I don't claim to know anything about culinary arts so don't roast me if this is really stupid. Hah! \nSo I have recently been introduced to Jamaican jerk sauce. I can't believe I had never heard of it before. It's so good! It wasn't what I was expecting at all, given the name. I was expecting something more tropical? A little fruity? I don't know, but definitely not clove-y and nutmeg-y! It's such a cozy, wintery taste for me because of course anything nutmeg screams the holiday season, but I've never heard anyone describe it like that and I don't know why. And I got to thinking, why don't I see jerk chicken at Thanksgiving or Christmas?? I'm not a big fan of turkey or ham, so I was thinking of doing a jerk chicken for Christmas! But.... idk.. roasting a whole chicken is a little out of my wheelhouse still, and there are enough recipes out there for that so getting to my actual question: I want to make a jerk chicken pot pie, but I can't find a recipe! What would you guys do? Also, what would you think if someone brought that to Christmas dinner? Would it be super weird? Do you agree that it's a winter vibe? Is it the worst idea ever?! Help!",

Garlic in the dough for flavor. Browned in the stove first, broiled in a high heat oven for a golden top. \n\nYet... it’s still garbage. Boring as all hell even though I added seasonings and the cheese was golden. Nothing close to how amazing even the cheapest take out pizza is. What magic do these pizza chains posses??

        "selftext": "Limoncello and other citrus-cellos are pretty fantastic and not terribly hard or expensive to make. They just take a bit of time and a little skill.\n\n**Making Limoncello**\nLet's start with the basic recipe. Actually, let's start with what limoncello is.\n\nLimoncello is an alcohol extraction of lemon zest essence combined with simple syrup. You soak lemon zest in alcohol, then add the simple syrup later.\n\n**Step 1 - **\n\nYou'll need:\n\n* 10 lemons\n*  750 ml of everclear or high proof vodka\n*  A big jar\n\nStart with the lemons and use a sharp knife to cut the zest off. The really important part of making limoncello is that you **don't include the white part along with the zest** the white part is the pith. It's extremely bitter and will wreck the flavor of the limoncello. This process takes a while, and you might want to watch a show or hang out with someone who is also cutting the zest off of the lemons. If you have a prized extra sharp knife, now is the time to use it. If you have been neglecting your knives and need to sharpen them, maybe you should consider doing that first. If you've never had a sharp knife before, consider looking into getting one. They make cooking far more pleasurable.\n\nToss the zest into the jar, and when you've done all 10 lemons pour the everclear in.\n\nStore the jar in a cool, dark place for two weeks. I've tried it for longer, but it doesn't really improve the flavor. In fact I think it might have made it a little more bitter. Two weeks is fine.\n\n**Step 2 -**\n\nAdd simple syrup to the extraction.\n\nSimple syrup is... simple to make. The basic recipe is a cup of water and a cup of white sugar, then heat it until it's dissolved. For this recipe I'd suggest doing two cups of water and sugar. Wait until it's cooled before adding to the alcohol extraction.\n\nIf you're using 90 proof everclear, I'd suggest doing a 50/50 mix of extraction and simple syrup. If you're using something lower proof, I'd suggest using a higher sugar to water ratio, and then using less syrup overall. This is a really great point to make this recipe your own. Some people like really sweet limoncello, while others don't like it too too sweet. I'd suggest adding the simple syrup up to a point, and then tasting to see if you think it needs more sweetness. Keep in mind the flavors will be powerful right now, and will balance out after sitting in the fridge for a few weeks. Don't balance sweet to bitter or strong flavors, balance sweet to the alcohol and lemony flavors. You can always add more simple syrup later, but you can't take it out.\n\nAt this point, leave the limoncello in the fridge for a few weeks. Some of the more bitter and astringent flavors will resolve and leave a very nice liqueur.\n\n**Variants**\n\nI've made grapefruit-cello and orange-cello as well as limoncello. I haven't messed with limes, but probably will at some point. I bet meyer lemons, pomelos, and satsumas would create some interesting results too. Grapefruits were a huge pain to collect zest from. Their zest layer is extremely thin and it was very difficult to get the zest without the white pith underneath. The end result was really interesting though. Not great on its own but added a very deep and complex flavor when used in mixed drinks. I think I used four big red grapefruits for the recipe. \n\nOrangecello was super easy. The zest was easy to get at, and made a very good and fragrant result. I added a vanilla bean sliced in half lengthwise during the extraction phase, and it was delicious in drinks and on ice cream.\n\n**Cocktails** \n\nThere are a ton of limoncello cocktails out there, so I'll only add a few simple ones that really exemplify the flavor of the liqueur.\n\nChampagne and limoncello - throw a floater of limoncello on top of champagne. It's delightful.\n\nLimoncello and Seltzer - mix 50/50 limoncello and seltzer, and serve on ice. Be sure to add a squeeze of lemon as well, because the sour flavor really helps to bring out the other flavors in the drink.\n\n**Other notes**\n\nI had some really great results mixing the grapefruit- and orange-cello together. The strong flavors and sweet flavors between the two balanced each other very nicely.",

Two weeks is fine.\n\n**Step 2 -**\n\nAdd simple syrup to the extraction.\n\nSimple syrup is... simple to make. The basic recipe is a cup of water and a cup of white sugar, then heat it until it's dissolved. For this recipe I'd suggest doing two cups of water and sugar. Wait until it's cooled before adding to the alcohol extraction.\n\nIf you're using 90 proof everclear, I'd suggest doing a 50/50 mix of extraction and simple syrup. If you're using something lower proof, I'd suggest using a higher sugar to water ratio, and then using less syrup overall. This is a really great point to make this recipe your own. Some people like really sweet limoncello, while others don't like it too too sweet. I'd suggest adding the simple syrup up to a point, and then tasting to see if you think it needs more sweetness. Keep in mind the flavors will be powerful right now, and will balance out after sitting in the fridge for a few weeks. Don't balance sweet to bitter or strong flavors, balance sweet to the alcohol and lemony flavors. You can always add more simple syrup later, but you can't take it out.\n\nAt this point, leave the limoncello in the fridge for a few weeks. Some of the more bitter and astringent flavors will resolve and leave a very nice liqueur.\n\n**Variants**\n\nI've made grapefruit-cello and orange-cello as well as limoncello. I haven't messed with limes, but probably will at some point. I bet meyer lemons, pomelos, and satsumas would create some interesting results too. Grapefruits were a huge pain to collect zest from. Their zest layer is extremely thin and it was very difficult to get the zest without the white pith underneath. The end result was really interesting though. Not great on its own but added a very deep and complex flavor when used in mixed drinks. I think I used four big red grapefruits for the recipe. \n\nOrangecello was super easy. The zest was easy to get at, and made a very good and fragrant result. I added a vanilla bean sliced in half lengthwise during the extraction phase, and it was delicious in drinks and on ice cream.\n\n**Cocktails** \n\nThere are a ton of limoncello cocktails out there, so I'll only add a few simple ones that really exemplify the flavor of the liqueur.\n\nChampagne and limoncello - throw a floater of limoncello on top of champagne. It's delightful.\n\nLimoncello and Seltzer - mix 50/50 limoncello and seltzer, and serve on ice. Be sure to add a squeeze of lemon as well, because the sour flavor really helps to bring out the other flavors in the drink.\n\n**Other notes**\n\nI had some really great results mixing the grapefruit- and orange-cello together. The strong flavors and sweet flavors between the two balanced each other very nicely.",

I was excited that I got to introduce them to Jufran Banana Sauce! For those of you unfamiliar, it's a banana-based ketchup developed in the Philippines during WW2 tomato shortages. You can find it at most Asian specialty grocers in my experience. \n\nOf course the other big tomato-based condiment is BBQ sauce, which usually has ketchup as the primary base. I wondered what would happen if you tried to make BBQ sauce using banana ketchup. I googled and I found other attempts at a nightshade-free BBQ sauce, usually something complicated involving aminos and balsamic vinegar and a vegetable puree. What happens though if you just take a regular ass BBQ sauce recipe and substitute tomato ketchup with banana ketchup? I found no answers so I decided to experiment and find out myself. \n\nThe basic recipe I used here was the Kansas City style BBQ sauce on Serious Eats: https://www.seriouseats.com/sauced-kansas-city-style-barbecue-sauce-recipe\n\nHere are some images of the sauce I made: https://imgur.com/a/nwD5ccC \n\nThere are some other issues. This recipe calls for mustard, and I'm aware some mustards might contain paprika which is apparently a nightshade concern. I used Grey Poupon dijon mustard because it was what I had on hand, some light googling makes me pretty sure it is nightshade-free. This recipe also calls for chili powder and cayenne... both are fine if you're just allergic to tomatoes, but again might cause problems for a general nightshade allergy. I divided my sauce into two batches, one with chili/cayenne and one without, to get an idea of how much difference it makes. \n\nThe results were really good. I did a blind taste test where I had my mom try (#1) a decent KC-style store-bought sauce from Stew Leonard's, then (#2) the plain banana version, then (#3) the banana plus the chili/cayenne. She said she thought the banana versions were smoother and less astringent but also tasted a little more corn syrup-y (they do not contain corn syrup). She definitely could not tell that any of the versions contained bananas. Her favorite was #3, but she said that both #2 and #3 were overwhelmingly better than #1. I feel like I can safely say this turned out well. \n\nTL;DR Yes it *is* possible to make a nightshade-free BBQ sauce using banana ketchup that will turn out better than store-bought.",

She definitely could not tell that any of the versions contained bananas. Her favorite was #3, but she said that both #2 and #3 were overwhelmingly better than #1. I feel like I can safely say this turned out well. \n\nTL;DR Yes it *is* possible to make a nightshade-free BBQ sauce using banana ketchup that will turn out better than store-bought.",

All the guides I've found so far are written for busy people who want to make soup in 30 minutes or less, but I want to do this thoroughly from scratch down to making my own broth. \n\nI'm hoping to master this and be able to make meals of a good cream soup, a salad with vegetarian protein, and some homemade rolls on a regular basis.",

But, seeing as I can only make one waffle at a time, I'm putting the finished waffles in the oven at 200 in a glass pan lined with parchment paper to keep them warm.\n\nProblem is, when I pull them out of the oven, they're much softer than when they went in, like they steamed or something. I'm sure I'm missing something obvious, but I'm hoping you can lead me to a crispy waffle eureka moment, so I can serve all my waffles together without losing their crunch.\n\nI appreciate you all and hope this isn't a very dumb question.",

            "selftext": "i recently ordered some baklava when i saw it in a local market’s bakery and when i got home and bit into it i noticed that it had a weird and unfamiliar taste. so i looked at the label on the sticker and it had ricotta cheese?? i don’t eat milk products other than butter due to some food sensitivity. but i wasn’t expecting cheese to be in baklava as i’ve never had one with it before. is this a type of baklava recipe specific to a certain region? i’m ngl i was really caught off guard bc baklava is usually a safe dessert for me but this one was different so i just wondered if this was a common thing? \n\nimportant to note, the bakery where i usually get my baklava is a mediterranian restaurant but this store didn’t have any other mediterranean food so maybe they just did it wrong? idk",

If you're curious, I'm making it with a smithwick red ale because that's what's in my fridge.\n\nHere is where I'm looking for advice. I made pretzels recently and I made an AMAZING cheese sauce with them. The pretzels are all gone but I have maybe 2 cups of cheese sauce left. I was thinking that might be a great addition to my bread tonight, but I'm not entirely sure how to incorporate it since it's a sauce. Most of the recipes I've looked up use shredded cheese in the bread. I'm afraid a cheese sauce would make it too moist and not cook right maybe?",

            "selftext": "OK so I am going to make a beer bread tonight to go with a stew for dinner. I've made it before, they're super easy and quick. If you're curious, I'm making it with a smithwick red ale because that's what's in my fridge.\n\nHere is where I'm looking for advice. I made pretzels recently and I made an AMAZING cheese sauce with them. The pretzels are all gone but I have maybe 2 cups of cheese sauce left. I was thinking that might be a great addition to my bread tonight, but I'm not entirely sure how to incorporate it since it's a sauce. Most of the recipes I've looked up use shredded cheese in the bread. I'm afraid a cheese sauce would make it too moist and not cook right maybe?",

Let mushrooms steep for 20 minutes. Strain, adding the liquid to a measure containing the 5 cups of water.\n\nPlace the soaked mushrooms into a food processor fitted with a blade attachment along with the cremini and white mushrooms. Pulse to finely chop. Transfer chopped mushrooms to a bowl.\n\nPlace butter and oil into a large soup pot on medium-high heat. When the butter melts and everything starts bubbling, add the onion, garlic, celery and carrots. Stir, cover and cook for 5 minutes or until vegetables are soft.\nAdd the chopped mushrooms, the mushroom-steeping liquid and a few sprigs of thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer and cook for 20 minutes.\n\nWhen the broth is cooked, strain and reserve the liquid for the soup. Discard the mushrooms and vegetables.\n\nMake the wild mushroom soup:\n\nHydrate any dried mushrooms in broth from above 1 cup of liquid per every ½ ounce of mushrooms\n\nMelt the olive oil in a 5-qt. or larger stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and shallots and cook until it’s beginning to brown (resist the urge to stir too often), about 4 minutes. Add the celery, fresh mushrooms, and 1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper; cook until the mushrooms become limp, 2 to 4 minutes up to 10-15 min total for onions and mushrooms.\n\nStir in the butter and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add 2 TBS flour and continue to stir for another 3 minutes to make the roux.\n\nDeglaze with some of the cognac, sherry or Madera here if desired\n\nAdd 2 Tbs. of the thyme and rehydrated mushrooms to pot (reserve some mushrooms for searing for garnish).\n\nAdd the broth, in stages, scraping up any browned bits in the pot with a wooden spoon. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, and cook until the mushrooms are tender, 7 to 10 minutes or up to 20 min to thicken. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.\n\nTransfer about half of the soup to a stand blender and process until smooth. Return the mixture to the pot.\n\nIn a separate medium sized bowl add the cream or crème fraîche and place one cup of the hot soup mix in the bowl and stir. This will temper the cream and keep it from curdling.\n\nPlace the cream mix back into the soup and stir in the sherry, and soy sauce. Add more salt and pepper to taste, if needed, bringing back to a simmer for another 10 minutes.\n\nIf using Morels, remove from liquid, strain and stir liquid into soup. Place Morels in soup bowls and ladle soup over them.\n\nGarnish each serving with a small pinch of the remaining 1 tsp. thyme. Perhaps drizzle olive oil, dab crème fraîche and serve some crusty bread.\n\nFor a topping, squeeze the reserved mushrooms to eliminate any excess moisture. sauté them in butter an oil until browned and season them with salt and pepper.",

I still think of it as \"that useless spoon with the hole in it.\" It's hard to believe it effectively reduces drag or whatever it's supposed to do in a risotto that wouldn't be achieved by a slightly smaller spoon or spatula. Yet most homes in America seem to have one. Do you use your risotto spoon?",

From a specific place? A specific cut?

And while I've got my personal favorite method down to a science, I made a big mistake with my most recent batch.\n\nI'm pretty sure the pork necks I used had been in the freezer a month or two too long, because the entire pot of pea soup tastes like an ash tray. The meat wasn't rotten, just old I think. I'm kicking myself for not thawing out and smelling the pork neck first. I wouldn't be so annoyed with myself normally, as ingredients for pea soup are relatively cheap. But I had used the last of my homemade chicken stock, and that stuff was liquid gold.\n\nThis is my desperate last-ditch effort to try and salvage this nappy batch of pea soup. At the risk of looking like an idiot, does anyone have any miraculous spice hacks on how I could mask or work with the weird taste of freezer-burned pork? Or was my pease porridge doomed from the start? Thanks!",

            "selftext": "I've been having amazing success making pea soup from scratch in my instant pot. And while I've got my personal favorite method down to a science, I made a big mistake with my most recent batch.\n\nI'm pretty sure the pork necks I used had been in the freezer a month or two too long, because the entire pot of pea soup tastes like an ash tray. The meat wasn't rotten, just old I think. I'm kicking myself for not thawing out and smelling the pork neck first. I wouldn't be so annoyed with myself normally, as ingredients for pea soup are relatively cheap. But I had used the last of my homemade chicken stock, and that stuff was liquid gold.\n\nThis is my desperate last-ditch effort to try and salvage this nappy batch of pea soup. At the risk of looking like an idiot, does anyone have any miraculous spice hacks on how I could mask or work with the weird taste of freezer-burned pork? Or was my pease porridge doomed from the start? Thanks!",

I get home, fully expecting the mash to be mediocre at best, so I remixed the recipe on the package to be essentially exactly the same as the Kenji recipe, only switching out potatoes for the flakes. I sit down to eat and that's when the confusion hits me - it legit tastes so much better and more potatoey.  \n\n\nThinking that it must've been me just starving yesterday, I do the same thing - switch out water for milk, add butter etc, and again - it's so much better than what I usually make.  \nIt's not even the texture or anything like that - I use a ricer, so it's pretty much identical, but it's the taste itself that is better.   \n\n\nSo here I am asking - have I been too snobby to ever consider using them and am only now discovering that it's actually an amazing shortcut or am I doing something very very wrong?",

So basically I've been wanting to make pie with a meat filling for a while now and this weekend I am planning to make chicken pot pie. But basically from what I've seen people either use like a pre-cooked shredded chicken and add them to the pie filling once its finished cooking or they cook the raw chicken pieces along with the filling, I am just wondering what are the pro and cons of each. I will be doing the pre-cooking (roasting probably) of the chicken if I go that option, not like store bought. So what do you guys recommend?\n\nAlso any other tips? \n\nThank you,",

A friend of mine says that when he makes stock, he’ll typically throw in a packet of gelatin to ensure good stock. I know that gelatinized stock is good, so I was wondering if anyone else does this? Or if you think it’s unnecessary as it will either gelatinize by itself or it won’t but will still be delicious? I’d love to hear everyone’s opinions. Thanks!",

All I normally do is scrub the exterior, poke several holes in the skin, and plop them on a baking tray.\n\nIf I try to bake at this temperature now, it takes roughly 80-90 minutes to pass the poke test and reach ~210F internal temp. What the heck could possibly DOUBLE the cooking time?\n\nI have an oven thermometer confirming the temperature in the oven and a probe thermometer for the potatoes. I've tried several different batches of potatoes from different sources with the same results.

I'd love to get y'all's advice. \n\nDo you have any ideas for variations on the dish that jazz it up a bit?\nOne of my biggest critiques is that the meat (or lentil) filling is often a homogenous texture and taste, so particularly I'm looking for ideas on that part, not necessarily the potatoes. (The internet already has a million and one potato variations, but the filling is almost always the same).\n\nTo start things off, I've been considering the merits of the following veg instead of peas and carrots:\n\n--spinach (or kale?)\n--green beans?\n--parsnips \n--mushroom medley\n--carmelized onion\n--one recipe i found called for asparagus but that seems like a strong flavor\n\nWould it be weird to include some sort of nut, like maybe pinenut, as a textural element and to add some earthy sweetness?\n\nFor the meat, what could be used other than ground beef or lamb? Maybe like a stew meat if it's broken down first, kinda like a pot roast? Would adding in some sausage to the ground beef be good, or is it too fatty? \n\nMost recipes call for tomato paste and wine as the main flavoring ingredients for the gravy. What are other flavor profiles that could be used? My grandmother uses Lipton soup mix powder for making Jewish style braised brisket, and I had a thought that it might be tasty to throw some of that in there.\n\nCurious to hear what ideas you all have.

Tonight neither of us could get through our plates of food. \n\nGuys I’m so sad!! I am embarrassed that I had friends eat this abomination, and awful that so much food was wasted but it was inedible.

I did (struggled through) 3 years of Computer Science and realised it's not for me.\n\nUntil this moment, I was a really introvert boy and pretty fat (huge food lover) Meanwhile, I redescovered myself and improved a lot (not only physically, but mentally too) when I got into fitness and weightlifting. By doing this, I also wanted to prep my own food to eat healthier/be careful about macros/etc.\n\nAt this point, I have also seen the joy of cooking, not only eating. So I've started going a little easier on my diets, since I got in shape, and started practicing on many dishes.\n\nAnd I found out that I thoroughly enjoyed every last bit of it: from the onion chopping to the plating.\n\nSo I've thought a lot about becoming a chef so I've looked into what this career means (seen how hard it is and sacrifices you have to make, which didnt really unmotivate me). I was also watching some culinary tv show's audition from my country and got hooked up with some of the contestants' journeys to becoming cooks. I kinda think I fit the criteria to start working in this industry.\n\n- I dont mind hard work, especially the kitchen one. Physical condition is not a problem. I know what I'll do the first time I set foot into a kitchen and I'm totally prepared.\n- I like working in a militarised-ish environment. I'm not very good socially speaking (far from being antisocial, but I really like focusing and working hard when I'm at the job). I mean, I also dont have many friends and I'm still kinda introvert haha.\n- I dont have a lot of expectations pay wise.

I'm the smallest spender I know.\n\nI have 2 options: struggle to work in a bigger city (capital actually) next to mine and look for a nicer (maybe even fine dining) restaurant to work in, prefferably under a known chef to learn a lot OR since I have zero experience, looking for a nice restaurant (we have nothing fine dining or at this level) in my city will suffice for now?\n\nI also wanna do a good culinary school after 6 months of work and then look to establish myself in the capital and start working at a good restaurant. After this, I wanna leave to other countries and learn there a lot more (hopefully a michelin restaurant too, who knows?).

So I added a couple medium sized cans of kidney beans, a medium sized can of Hormel beanless chili, a can of peeled tomatoes I cut up, and then browned 2 lbs of turkey sausage in a health stick of butter and then added mushrooms before adding them to the chili. Add in some beef broth, onion powder, and some red chili flakes and I let it set for about 8 hours. \n\nIt was spicy, but with a dollop of sour cream it was a delicious chili. Even without the sour cream it was good. \n\nSo now we get to the title. Would it be a good idea to add carrots to this chili? I was thinking of slicing them into disks. I like soft carrots, but I know carrots can go too soft and kind of turn to mush in a good long slow cook. If I do add them, should it be like an hour before serving/Tupperwaring?\n\nI don't see carrots in chili often, so I thought it would fit the title of abombination chili. \n\nIf I had to guess on the proportions (and googling for canned proportions) I'll list them below. \n\n1. 2lbs 85% lean ground turkey\n2. 1 regular stick of butter\n3. 16 ounces sliced brown mushrooms\n4. 24 oz can of sloppy joe sauce\n5. 14.5 oz canned peeled tomatoes (drained in the sink, I didn't add the tomato juice)\n6. 2 16oz cans of kidney beans (drained before adding)\n7. 15oz beanless chili (which may or may not be meant to be a chip dip)\n8. At most a 1/2 cup of onion powder, at least a third. I know it sounds like a lot... Probably because it is. \n9. Maybe 2 tablespoons of chili flakes. I just kind of sprinkled it over the chili before stirring with the pour end open. I didn't do it accidentally. I think my thought process was 'chili is normally spicy, so this seems right'. I don't think it was more than two tablespoons. Probably closer to 1 tablespoon and 1 or 2 teaspoons. \n10. 15-25oz Beef Broth. Again, I could middle ground this but it was enough to make it appropriately liquidy. \n\nIn the cooking I went about it probably wrong (based on the recipes I looked up in trying to recreate this) where I started by making the chili sauce, then added the meat, then seasoned with the powder and flakes. \n\nAll opinions welcome, thank you anyone who read that whole mess.\n\nEdit: I think I overstated my onion powder and walked it back a bit.",

        "selftext": "Edit to add more details:\n\nI made chili this last Friday using tri-tip leftover from Thanksgiving. I've been enjoying glorious chili meals for the last 5 days (RIP my wife and son) - were talkin' chili with cornbread, huevos rancheros, tater tots topped with chili. I've been reheating the chili each day to simmering/bubbling, adding new water, and then chilling again when done with the meal. The temp reaches and stays above 165f each time for more than 20 minutes. \n\nWith all the outdoor decorating, tree cutting, and whatnot this season, the chili has been keeping me warm, full, and energized all weekend. \n\nHonestly, I know the end has come for this pot of spectacular, spicy brown gold. I was sort of curious to see how far one could theoretically take this safely and to get an idea of what others do to big pots of chili or stew. I've never had an issue doing it this way, or gotten food poisoning, but it seems I'm a little loose compared to others when it comes to food safety in my kitchen.\n\nCheers, I'm gonna go dump these leftovers and try not to shed a tear for all the joy it brought me.",

He's got some great fresh-frozen (I think that's what you call it, when it was frozen immediately after being caught?) salmon fillets, and I want to do them justice. \n\nWhat are some of y'all's favorite ways to prepare salmon? I've cooked it on the grill before, but that's about it, and it's too cold out for grilling right now, so I'm thinking either in the pan or in the oven. Thoughts? Tips? Tricks? Recipes?

Some dishes include chicken Alfredo, chicken katsu, chicken and rice, homemade fries, burgers, homemade Mac and cheese, sweet potato casserole, the basics. Everything from scratch. Besides the buns for the burgers lol. I am very excited to learn how to make bread though. Anyways, I have about 40 days until my spring semester starts. I was watching Julie and Julia last night and got inspired to do the same thing Julie did. So I need recommendations for a cookbook! Maybe a themed one? I was thinking a recipe a day but my boyfriend suggested 1-3 a week to keep it realistic and manageable. I really wanted to get a studio Ghilbi themed cookbook. I looooveeeeee all of the movies and the foods are so beautiful. I would love it and I’m always up for a challenge. Anyways, help please! I’ve been in bed for too long. Too sad. I need something to do. Thanks for all the help :)",

I cook it for about 10 mins, butter baste it, and make sure to let it rest. I wanted to know if i can maybe cook it for 12 mins? Do i need a higher heat? Do i need to flip it more(i flip every 2 mins or so)?. \n\nAny tips would be helpful.\n\nPS. I Am aware or reverse searing and sous vide methods which i do like more but i want to practice doing a pan fry only method.
