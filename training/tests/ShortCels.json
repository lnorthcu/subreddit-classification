        "selftext": "The period between 2000 BC and 1975 was the golden age of humanity. Praising virgin marriage, slut shaming, stoning to death if found guilty of adultery, fearing hell, no birth control. And all this was done to keep female hypergamy in check. \n\nDuring the stone age or the ice age women were hypergamous as fuck. And all the successful civilizations knew this, so they implemented patriarchy to prevent it. Had it not been for patriarchy, the world would've been like Mad Max type dystopia. Hardworking and successful men, men with high IQ fucked plenty of holes and passed on their genes. Patriarchy prevented their genes from phasing out of the genepool. \n\nBut now there is no patriarchy to prevent female hypergamy. Women have been given full sexual freedom and they'll only choose those men who can make their holes tingle.

            "selftext": "The period between 2000 BC and 1975 was the golden age of humanity. Praising virgin marriage, slut shaming, stoning to death if found guilty of adultery, fearing hell, no birth control. And all this was done to keep female hypergamy in check. \n\nDuring the stone age or the ice age women were hypergamous as fuck. And all the successful civilizations knew this, so they implemented patriarchy to prevent it. Had it not been for patriarchy, the world would've been like Mad Max type dystopia. Hardworking and successful men, men with high IQ fucked plenty of holes and passed on their genes. Patriarchy prevented their genes from phasing out of the genepool. \n\nBut now there is no patriarchy to prevent female hypergamy. Women have been given full sexual freedom and they'll only choose those men who can make their holes tingle. The only superior genes which is going to prevail is \"good looks\" and \"great height\" and nothing else.

To explicit my point, I am short (5’5), and I found the love of my life (5’2 maybe?) as there were no signs of anything going better for me. She just spawned into my life, I turned my life around for her I wasn’t really into legal things, I was suicidal, my only bother was my sport and now everything has changed.

But me and this girl,we created a good bond,she really seemed to like me and we were Very loving to eachother.  She was 14 at the time and a legit 6/10 foid. There was a day she was laying on my lap,and a girl yelled at us: omg,you too look so cutie,you would form a good couple! Every now and then i think od her,and How i didnt take action to Kiss her while i had the chance,because i was in love with her.\n\n I feel like a simp,because yesterday i dreamt with her. In my dreaming,i met her again after all those years,i have recurring dreams about her,i dunno what my subconciously wanna Tell me. Then i checked her out on social media and she is dating a Guy,who is prolly my age. Before dating this current Guy,she was dating another one who studied with me. I feel like shit,because she gave some validation,she made me feel wanted and loved by someone for the First time,but for her,i was nothing but a Guy she was into in the past but doesnt give a fuck about my existence as we stopped talking.

My wife had told me if I accepted she'd bake a Smash Bros themed cake for my birthday. I had to refuse, mainly because of the chance that I'd take of getting arrested because of my involvement of the robbery. Lebarion began to insult me in unison with my wife, and it ultimately led to Lebarion grabbing at my phone, and making a phone call to a friend of his, saying he'd need a ride on the next day to the mentioned corner store.\n\nI knew that this friend wasn't in the position to drive safely, and I effectively had to drive Lebarion to safety from the police without incident, and I was right. immediately after the robbery, a chase ensued and it ultimately ended in a near fatal crash.\n\nas a white male with an elevated socio-economic status as opposed to an african american, my wife entailed I could have successfully driven him away from the scene without incident in my Prius due to my influence upon white, all-american cops as a fellow white male, which is the makeup of most of our police department.\n\nmy wife was sobbing heavily over the phone, telling me that I was a huge loser and she would never come back to live with me. Though, again, she was simply angry over the circumstances. later on, she came back to my house after I told her that I obtained another job, and obtained a small complementary, under the table paycheck on my first day.\n\neven now that she's back to sleeping on the couch in my living room, which isn't normal from her sleeping on her separate bed in our bedroom. I really didn't mean to hurt her, but what else could I have done?

Or you know, call me an asshole and chad or whatever. Anyway here goes.\n\nI was born in Denmark 17 years ago. I was the typical child wonder in terms of maths, reading and learning English. I got bullied every day from when I was 6 years old to 14. I had 1 good friend and a couple of other friends. I had a girlfriend in 5th grade...for a couple of days. In 7th,8th and 9th grade I got some really good friends and I went to parties and such. At these parties, I tried my luck but never had any success. \nI have, and still do play a lot of video games, im not and wasn't very athletic, and i didn't really have anything i was really good at other than school and video games. i started playing piano but i wasn't very good.\n\nSo far I'm guessing most of you can relate. \nAfter 9th grade when I was 15 I signed up for something called afterschool. I was gonna live on an island for the next year or so, with 150 other kids like me. This is a pretty big island with like 3000-4000 people on it, and it's in Denmark so don't think of it as an island in the Bahamas with palm trees and such.\nThis is where my life truly changed i belive. Normally on schools like this you stay there for a week, and go home in the weekends, but since this was on an island you only really went home every 3-4 weeks. I had the normal classes, English, Maths, Chemistry and so on but i also had to chose 6 or more special classes that i then would spend most of my time on. I chose Hunting, Musisc classes, Scuba diving, Pilots license, Sea kayaking, Advanced english and falcon hunting.\n\nyeah i know right, but this is just to set the tone of the school, we had to choose 6 or a few more out of 36 choices like this.\nOn the first week of this school i got my first girlfriend. I had my hunting license already, and one the girls in my class found it hot that i was good at shooting. over at few days we went from acquaintances to a couple. I lived for most of the school in a small house with 5 other guys who became my best friends. Almost everybody lived in small rooms in buildings but we lived in a small house of our own, which really helped us get the pus pus in the long run.\n\nI just realized how long this is so ill wrap it up.\n\nThe year went by, all in all i was in 3 relationships, all of them sexual since the age of consent is 16 in denmark. When i was home and invited to parties, and i got really good at playing piano. I learned a bunch of things and got kinda popular-ish. Me and my roomies played DnD which started small with only about 3 people but it evolved to a point where we at the standard session had 8 players, 2 Dm's and people who would come in and watch and laugh with us.\n\nAfter the school ended and I broke up with my then girlfriend, met up with a female friend of mine who later became my long-distance girlfriend now of 7 months.\nThe school started on august 12th 2018 and ended 29 of june 2019. Right now i go to school in copenhagen where i've achived my childhood dream of actually having friends,getting hit on by girls at parties and having something im really good at (piano).\n\nThis was really long which i didn't mean to but there you go, the life of a 185cm (a bit more than 6 feet), good looking ( in my own humble opinion) danish boy.

        "selftext": "Why don't you guys support each other (ACTUALLY support each other) here instead of keeping each other miserable?\n\nLook. All of you are in desperate need of mental health help and you all for the most part seem pretty self aware of that. you also seem to understand that wallowing in the fact that the world is cruel and superficial will do nothing. but let me just repeat that real quick. WALLOWING IN THE FACT THAT THE WORLD IS CRUEL AND SUPERFICIAL WILL DO  N O T H I N G. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Every second you spend feeling sorry for yourself is wasted. Im a hypocrite for saying this. I spend a disgusting amount of my time feeling sorry for myself. But i want to change, i dont want to feel sorry for myself ever again, because this is no way to spend a life, it's so repetitive, sad and empty. You need to understand, that you CAN do better, you CAN improve yourself and your life. Happiness is possible, but sometimes it's difficult. Sometimes you have to live a \"lie\" to be happy. And that's okay. There's nothing wrong with the blue pill. Life is literally what you make of it. The amount of effort and time you spend in improving yourself is what you get out of it. And I don't mean superficial improvement, I mean mindset improvement. Some of you are racist, most of you guys are incredibly sexist, and all of you are in major denial of some real facts of life. You deny that the situation youre in has anything to do with your personality and outlook on life. And that's just not true. I'm not saying you don't struggle, im sure all of you have a story for how you ended up with this mindset, perhaps you were bullied, or abused, or struggled with mental health issues that led you down this rabbit hole. Most of you probably have autism, and im not saying that to be cruel, im saying that because i can see how that would make many more obstacles in your life. \n\nI feel sorry for all of you, but at the same time some of you are just straight up horrible. I dont know why, but racism is REALLY rampant in the incel community, so it's pretty obvious why people are telling you why your personality is the reason you cant get a girlfriend. but besides that, there's a few other obvious things people are referring to when they talk about an unattractive personality: depression, lack of perspective, and covert narcissism. And all of those are probably tied together for some of you. People don't like to be around someone who is a downer, because many people are worn out themselves, so if they ever have the choice they're going to surround themselves with happy people. It's unfortunate, but it's true. You have to be happy with yourself before trying to find another to make you happy. And if you put a ton of effort into being happy and still cant find another person, well, at least now you are happier with yourself.\n\n I highly suggest that you get a dog (ONLY IF YOURE ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT) because they are very loving and kind creatures, and a definite helpful remedy to depression. \n\nLookism is real, there's no denying that. But the world is unforgiving and cruel, and it's YOUR choice as to whether or not that makes you miserable. I believe that-for at least most people-rewiring your brain to be less superficial is completely possible. So why not live a blue pill lie if you have a choice. The black pill is also a lie. It's projection of your own beliefs. You CHOSE to live your life thinking that you will always be miserable. You chose to focus on the things in your life that you cannot control. Don't do this to yourself. If you truly believe that you are ugly enough that nothing, ever, not surgery, not an amazing personality, will ever get you a girlfriend, dont worry about it. I know it's not that simple, but it can be done. Dont let your mind think about it. Ever. Just dont. What's the point fantasizing? Either work towards improvement, with motivation and hope, or, if improvement in one part of your life is impossible, use your time to find joys in other parts of life. Art, music, writing, reading, just learning in general helps you feel like at the end of the day you have done something that makes you a better person. Or you could hang out on this toxic sub. It's up to you. \n\nSo get off reddit right now and do something, ANYTHING, that can make your life better. And when you fail, try again and fail better next time. I'm going to be real with you, I feel sorry for a lot of you because i also feel sorry for myself. Honestly i think part of the reason i spent so much time writing this post was also to motivate myself. What's the worst that's gonna happen? Maybe you'll still be alone, but at least you're going to feel better about yourself for trying your best. Log off reddit right now (im doing the same) and dont allow yourself to fall deeper into this horribly toxic mindset, spend every second of your time being happy through some sort of improvement (mentally more importantly than superficially) and always, always, always keep yourself busy with it. There's nothing wrong with the blue pill.",

I dont know why, but racism is REALLY rampant in the incel community, so it's pretty obvious why people are telling you why your personality is the reason you cant get a girlfriend. but besides that, there's a few other obvious things people are referring to when they talk about an unattractive personality: depression, lack of perspective, and covert narcissism. And all of those are probably tied together for some of you. People don't like to be around someone who is a downer, because many people are worn out themselves, so if they ever have the choice they're going to surround themselves with happy people. It's unfortunate, but it's true. You have to be happy with yourself before trying to find another to make you happy. And if you put a ton of effort into being happy and still cant find another person, well, at least now you are happier with yourself.\n\n I highly suggest that you get a dog (ONLY IF YOURE ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT) because they are very loving and kind creatures, and a definite helpful remedy to depression. \n\nLookism is real, there's no denying that. But the world is unforgiving and cruel, and it's YOUR choice as to whether or not that makes you miserable. I believe that-for at least most people-rewiring your brain to be less superficial is completely possible. So why not live a blue pill lie if you have a choice. The black pill is also a lie. It's projection of your own beliefs. You CHOSE to live your life thinking that you will always be miserable. You chose to focus on the things in your life that you cannot control. Don't do this to yourself. If you truly believe that you are ugly enough that nothing, ever, not surgery, not an amazing personality, will ever get you a girlfriend, dont worry about it. I know it's not that simple, but it can be done. Dont let your mind think about it. Ever. Just dont. What's the point fantasizing? Either work towards improvement, with motivation and hope, or, if improvement in one part of your life is impossible, use your time to find joys in other parts of life. Art, music, writing, reading, just learning in general helps you feel like at the end of the day you have done something that makes you a better person. Or you could hang out on this toxic sub. It's up to you. \n\nSo get off reddit right now and do something, ANYTHING, that can make your life better. And when you fail, try again and fail better next time. I'm going to be real with you, I feel sorry for a lot of you because i also feel sorry for myself. Honestly i think part of the reason i spent so much time writing this post was also to motivate myself. What's the worst that's gonna happen? Maybe you'll still be alone, but at least you're going to feel better about yourself for trying your best. Log off reddit right now (im doing the same) and dont allow yourself to fall deeper into this horribly toxic mindset, spend every second of your time being happy through some sort of improvement (mentally more importantly than superficially) and always, always, always keep yourself busy with it. There's nothing wrong with the blue pill.",

This Chad is what I would consider a weak 8 facially but a strong 8 overall considering that he is likely around 6 foot rather than 5'6. But, for the purposes of the experiment, I made him 5'6. The results were terrible. He got about 20 likes within the first day and then it dwindled off to less than 5 a day. Today I deleted the account. I only managed to actually match with 5 of the women. Only 2 messaged him. They were low quality women, one was an average black girl with a nice body, the other was a 4/10 white woman who was worthless. Both unmatched when I attempted to make the conversation sexual. They were enthusiastic until I moved things to hookup territory. \n\nI was quite hopeful coming into this when I saw the likes coming in, but in the end 5'6 seems to be over unless you're a solid 8+. He could have likely gotten a girlfriend easily, but she would be much below his looks level and it would be like a 6' normies relationship. Another poster was successful with a 5'8 Tyrone, so 5'8 seems like the cutoff before women see you as low quality regardless of your face. My condolences to whoever is unfortunate enough to be 5'6 or under.",

People see a short dude with his girl friends and just assume that he's fucking all of them when that's not even close to happening.\n\nGrowing up, I always had more girl friends than guy friends (thanks mostly to the fact that I have two sisters, so I was around girls all the time). I still socialize easily with women. Many of them are decently attractive. Between 16 and 21, I always had some guy friends ask me how I get so many girls. They assume that because I hanged out with girls and talked with them easily that I must be fucking all of them. That is far from the truth, but these same guys would later on and go say stuff like, \"So I know this 5'5\" guy who talks with so many girls it's insane!\"\n\nWomen love befriending short dudes for these reasons.\n\nShort men are less physically and sexually imposing. When most women look at a short man, they don't really see a man. Short men tend to have exhibit neoteny; In humans, this happens when a human's legs are proportionally shorter and head is proportionally larger. This makes women more attractive to men, but for women it illicits a response similar to a mother and her child, or a pet owner and their kitten. Women feel extremely comfortable around short men and might even adore them as they would a child, but there's no sexual tension involved. And because short men are physically smaller, women don't instinctively feel threatened by them as they would with a more normal-sized man.\n\nShort men tend to compensate for their lack of physical presence with personality and charisma. A lot of women like this because it's easier to talk to someone who knows how to talk with others. Since women are very social, they really like this and want to be friends with sociable people.\n\nShort men give more attention and time to a woman than other men do. Most short guys subconsciously know that women don't find them sexually attractive, so they try to make up for it by showering girls with attention and favours AKA being an orbiter. Women love this because they can get the validation they need from a guy who sort of looks like a man without having to give him anything in return.\n\nCombine these traits together and women find short men to be the perfect friend; A male who is not a physical threat, who can talk normally and make them feel special. Don't be fooled though, he's not fucking any of them, nor will his girl friends wingwoman him. Also, he'll only continue being friends with them as long as he showers them with attention and listens to their problems. Once he stops doing that, the friendship quickly ends. Once he starts getting sexual or making an advance on a girl, he'll be seen as a creep/nice guy whatever you name it.\n\nHowever, the average man, who is typically never friends with women sees this short guy walking with a bunch of girls and thinks, \"Man, this guy is a womanizer!\" He doesn't know any better, but he will tell his friends about this womanizer short guy, then the word will spread and spread until a normie comes on Reddit and says, \"I know a 4'10\" guy who gets lots of chicks!\"\n\nAlso, the short guy will likely lie and say that he's hooked up with some of them to save face and not appear like an orbiter, making this myth even more apparent.\n\nTrust me, if personality and being friends with women were all that is needed to get women, I'd be drowning in pussy right now. However, I'm still a kissless virgin. Nobody in my social life knows this because they just assume that I'm a womanizer.",
