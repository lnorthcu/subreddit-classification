0,Cooking,"
I’m an amateur cook, but I’ve been playing around with things many people find difficult (which in reality, is just the amount of time you need to dedicate to make something); homemade puff pastry, tiramisu with homemade ladyfingers, homemade pizza, kebabs, etc. 

I think I’ve got some form of “culinary touch” - I just manage to mix random ingredients and somehow it works, usually, I.e. had some cooked boiled groats left over from a dinner, so instead of eating them with let’s say butter and egg, I made something resembling a bechamel to top it off, without following a recipe (sounds braggy, but I just want to emphasise that I like to tinker around and be creative). 

I’ve been watching some recipes/YouTube channels, but I just can’t get around doing some of the dishes because I live with my parents and I don’t do my shopping usually (Haven’t got a car yet), but even if there is, for example, chicken breast, I just don’t know what to do with it.

Bit of a brain storm of a post, but hopefully someone relates or has advice, I want to find new recipes but the ones I find require a lot of prep and thought into buying the ingredients - they can’t be done ‘spontaneously’",0

3,Cooking,"I have around 4kg of frozen steaks that have been at the bottom of my chest freezer for about 2 years. I bought a 1/4 a cow a while back and we didn't get through it all. I know that the quality of the meat degrades over time and it becomes less tasty.   


I was just wondering if there is anything I can do to get something out of the meat, or if I should just throw it away?",0
4,Cooking,"I heard you can pasteurize it in jars with high heat. But at what temperature should I do it and for how long? I am planning on travelling back to my hometown and need a way to keep it fresh for about 14 hours without a fridge. I heard pasteurization allows for room temperature storage for up to a year. And I heard you can sanitize them in a brine solution. if I should brine, then at what salt to water ratio?

5,Cooking,"I'll be making homemade pasta with marinara (and meatballs) this weekend for 6 people. When it comes to saucing the pasta at the end, that's easy to do when serving just 2-4 people — the pasta will fit in the pan with the sauce.

8,Cooking,"I usually keep some reserve marinade left over when making it for meats, however today i did not keep any aside for two Pork Chops that i will be frying and then finshing off in the oven. The remaining/extra marinade in the bowl i wanted to use it towards the end of the cooking in the oven, maybe 5 mins before just to brush over the chops, but as its been mixed with the meat juices how long does it have to be cooked for in order to kill all the bacteria? 

Is that 5 min period enough or do i need more time, as i have always been a bit weary to re-use any of the left over marinade that has had contact with meat partway through cooking. Let me know regarding in the oven and also how i would also safely do this if i wanted to treat the remaining as a pan sauce for example?",0

13,Cooking,"And I’m talking throughout the decades.  80s, 90s, 00’s, 10’s, now?

I’m in the market for a grill right now with a side-burner (my current weber doesn’t have a sideburner).   I want to get a Weber because they seem to last and at the very least have good support, but I’m definitely not locked into them.  Perusing the used market, I’m seeing some really old stuff and I’m honestly a bit tempted.

Here are examples ofw hat I’m talking about:

I’m very tempted to get one from the 80s if I can find one, except they have horizontal burners and not vertical burners.  I just love the wood, and how easy everything is to access (no stupid flimsy sharp doors).

15,Cooking,"Fried starch potatoes.

So I was cooking a bunch of what I had in stock, and one thing already was going to occupy my oven.

I knew this kick ass recipe with pre boiled potatoes in cast iron in the oven in beef grease. 

So me giving it a twist I pre boiled (and quartered) and did them in the skillet on the stove. Some rough scraping later all the starch from the outside and tiny bits browned nicely in a powder form which clumped a bit. 

Ever had those sandy biscuits? Yeah that but with potatoes.

Might be your thing, might be not.",0
16,Cooking,"My family and I do a ton of cooking on cast iron, and this skillet specifically gets a ton of action. It’s a breeze to cook on, but there are some areas where the seasoning is uneven or has chipped/flaked over time. It’s probably ~13 years old.

My wife asked me to strip it an reseason it, which I’m generally fine to do. I have some days off coming up and using one to do three or four rounds of reseasoning in the oven wouldn’t be bad, and I might be able to catch up on some of my steam or reading backlog if I play my cards right. But I wonder if I’d be foolish by doing so. After all, these things were literally carried across the country strapped to a horse’s butt or the outside of a covered wagon. I probably don’t need to stress about a little uneven seasoning. 

What do you all think?

It looks a little parched in the pic because I hadn’t re-oiled yet after cleaning.

My question is, will the raspberry be too potent, should I add anything else to the shallot and balsamic reduction outside of what was mentioned (or should anything be removed)? I do know that it thickens up quickly which isn’t what I would want, so it would either need to be cut with something else like alcohol (whiskey or vodka?), maybe even cream?",0

I make this in the instant pot: 
My usual recipe is:  onion, carrot &amp; celery (sweated), add ham bone any any leftover pieces of ham, combo of veggie stock &amp; water, white northern beans, couple fresh crushed garlic, sprig of fresh time thyme, 1 bay leaf, white pepper.    That's it, except ONLY add salt after it's fully cooked and then only if necessary.

I have lived away from my family a long time, but recently moved back home.  We are loving being near but I have noticed something that I never did before.  My grandmother and mother are considered 'great cooks' within the family. Having been away, distance wise, during all of my 20's I have learned to cook on my own and started  to find it a bit laughable when my mama is in the kitchen making something 'homemade'.  I realized, she is just mixing boxes of processed foods together and calling it homemade.. nothing is ever 'homemade! 

For example, when I make soup I make homemade broth, chop my veggies, spice up my soup. When my mama makes soup, it is canned veggies, packaged broth dumped in, a package of soup spices mixed in. Everyone raves what an amazing cook she is..

Another example, making spaghetti .. we make homemade pasta sauce and tomato paste,, chop fresh veggies, add beef .. along with a homemade noddle. Never thought twice about it. Just the way our household does it.. Mama take a can of sauce, dumps it into a pan. 

Let me be clear, no way is better or worse, I just am taken back by the fact that this type of cooking is considered homemade ! To me, it is similar to heating up a microwave dinner! Nothing is fresh, or actually handcrafted.

97,Cooking,"There are a lot of advantages to home-ground meat. You don’t need expensive equipment. In fact, I personally don’t like the kitchen aid attachment for a number of reasons. 

Some things to keep in mind when grinding meat yourself. Temperature is critical. I can’t stress this enough. The meat needs to be cold cold cold the entire time. If it ever feels warm to the touch or even room temp, you want to stick it in the refrigerator or freezer until it’s cold again. If the meat gets too warm, or overworked, it can “break.” When this happens and it’s cooked the fat will render and become greasy and the meat will be dry and grainy. A light touch is best. You want to handle/process the meat as little as possible. 

You have to step down the grind. Hamburger and sausage have a relatively fine grind. In order to achieve this, you want to grind it coarsely first, then the fine grind. 

Cut the meat into 1 inch cubes and spread out on w flat tray. Put in the freezer until the meat begins to firm up, but not frozen. Grind on the largest die and spread the meat back out on a tray and put back in the freezer until just firmed. Repeat the process with the next sized die until you reach the desired size. 

If the meat starts to look slimy or greasy it’s broken. Stop the process immediately, chill all the meat and clean the grinder. If the die gets clogged or sinew wraps around the knife it can over agitate the meat and lead to breaking.",0

106,Cooking,"Hello everyone!

I am hosting my first Christmas Eve this year! I am so super excited and also a little nervous, but luckily the pressure isn’t too high since Christmas Eve for us is just immediate family (husband, parents, siblings). Curious to know what y’all will be serving. Below is my tentative menu.

**Appetizer:** Cranberry Brie bites OR charcuterie board
**Main course:** Either prime rib or beef tenderloin, garlic buttered green beans with slivered almonds, mashed potatoes &amp; gravy, home made Mac &amp; cheese, rolls/bread. May possibly also add a roasted vegetable blend (Brussels sprouts, carrots, broccolini, sweet potato) but I have some picky family members and not sure if its worth the added hassle.
**Dessert:** TBD, will probably pick something up from a local bakery because I only have so much time to cook. Thinking either cheesecake or pecan pie. Will also have tons of cookies as we are having a Christmas bake-a-thon the Sunday prior. Hehe.

I’m racking my brain trying to figure out when and how to prepare my food. We will be spending the morning/early afternoon with my husbands family on Christmas Eve day.  There will only be about a three hour gap between being at my MIL’s house and when I plan on having my family over. My initial plan was to cook Thursday night (christmas eve eve, lol), refrigerate it then reheat in the oven evening of. However, I don’t think prime rib or beef tenderloin will hold up great after refrigeration and reheating (someone with experience please let me know). Also, I know there will be leftovers I’d want to eat but I heard its a no-no to refrigerate and reheat twice (again, please let me know in the comments if that’s true or not). 

The other idea was just to get everything cut up, prepared, measured, and set up and just go into a rage of cooking as soon as I get home from my MIL, but that sounds.. stressful.. but do-able. What does everyone do with limited time?",0

* nonstick
* oven temp doesn't matter
* will only use low or med heat
* 8"" and 10"" preferred, I have a 12"" and barely use it
* cool, comfortable handles
* does not need lid
* gas stove
* preferred handles that are more horizontal than angled up
* under $120 for both
* able to be used at least three times a week, up to daily

Here's my situation. A year or so ago I received a very, very nice set of All Clad frying pans. These beasts are still going strong, I never use metal, medium heat at most, always hand wash, let them cool on the stove, and I adore the pan. But the handles are the absolute, without a doubt, fucking worst handles I have ever used in my 19 years of cooking in restaurants and at home. They have pissed me off since day one and I've had it with them. Maybe it's the way I grip them but the top five reviews on Amazon, a site which is mostly people dishwashing nonstick after shoving metal against a pan, all say the handles suck too.

Either way, I'm done with this type of handle. As much as I love the pan, the handles have finally ruined me on the brand, and using these frying pans just pisses me off to no end. I want to love them, I do, but I just can't anymore.

So! I'm looking for a set of 8"" and 10"" frying pans in the high end range of cooking with a similar pan style but a comfortable handle. I don't need a set as the other equipment I have is barely used or doesn't need an upgrade.

109,Cooking,"My wife wants a roast for Christmas. She wanted a roast last year as well, and it almost ended up in divorce when I cut up the beef for a pot roast.

So, I just failed on my test run tonight, and want some advice what I need to do to fix it.

I bought a 3 lb choice eye round. Pulled it out an hour prior to putting it in the oven. Made an emulsion of fresh rosemary, sage, and thyme with olive oil and about 3 tsp of garlic salt. Rubbed it all over, and it sat for about a half hour.

Roasted it in a roaster pan at 450 for 15 minutes, then dropped it to 325 for about 1 hour and 10 minutes. I pulled it when the meat thermometer read 125 (I was trying for 120, but it jumped 10 degrees in 10 minutes). Rested for 20 minutes under foil before cutting.

It was not good: tough and chewy. Tasted like a crappy shoe leather steak. I'd say it looked medium well. The flavor of the crust was good, but the texture was borderline inedible.

Is it as simple as needing a better cut of meat, or is there a step I missed? Do I need different oven temperature?

filling: the Ideal Dumpling had a pork filling (pork, kimchi, and onion according to the menu, but i’m certain there was no kimchi in the ones i got that day so they might have been off menu that day). they seemed to be very simple - i couldn’t see or taste any cabbage or tofu or anything like that, but they had such a savoury (not spicy) kick. it was a darkish brown so i assume there was soy sauce involved. in my own dumplings the meat tends to clump together into a hard little sausage that shrinks away from the wrapper and the meat is much paler. how can i get a filling that stays juicy and tender?

wrapper: i’ve been using store bought frozen wrappers but the seem to be thicker and more gelatinous when cooked than the Ideal. should i make my own to get the right thickness?

cooking: these dumplings were deep fried but when i deep fry dumplings they tend to be very greasy - a lot of oil seems to get inside the dumpling itself. the wrapper tends to be dry and hard on the outside with a lot of blisters and almost gooey inside - while the Ideal Dumpling had a thin, crunchy golden crust. i like to make big batches and freeze them so i’ve experimented with different combos of steaming, pan frying, deep frying (from fresh or frozen) but i haven’t found the right technique.

He cooks the chicken at 450 degree's for 45mins which seems really high temp to me. im also using a dry chicken not a wet chicken. will this change the way it cooks as it will have less liquids over all on it?

also because the chicken isn't in direct heat from the pan surface is this the reason he cooks it at such a high ambient temperature ?

i just dont wanna burn my rice. im using basmati which is fairly hardy. i did see video's where people put the rice and all seasons in the pan and chicken on top and cover with tin foil but ngl... i liked the way the cooked rice looked in the video here and he seems to be the only one doing it this way.

141,Cooking,"I’m genuinely curious in a sort of “sociology” sense I guess (for lack of a better term) - as somebody who cooks for friends, and also has worked for years in restaurants (as a server), onions seem to be by far the most commonly hated ingredient. And it’s not just a simple dislike of onions, the people that don’t like onions fucking HATE onions and are extremely vocal about it.

Like there are people who don’t like broccoli, or spice, and that’s fine, everybody has their preferences. But they’ll just ask nicely if their dish can be made less spicy because they don’t like spice.

But when it comes to onions, it’s like grown adults revert back into being toddlers, and have to let me and everybody else know how horrible onions are. There’s even an entire subreddit (r/onionhate) that circlejerks this distaste.

So what is it exactly? People seem to outgrow other food pickiness, but onion hate never goes away. They seem to take some kind of pride with how much they hate onions, like it’s a badge of honor.",1

What do I do? 

Here is the recipe I use for my question: 

Ingredients: 
- Fresh Beets (peeled and cut into cubes/chunks) 
- Carrots (peeled and sliced) 
- Sweet Potatoes (peeled and cut into cubes/chunks) 
- Yellow Onions (coarsely chopped) 
- Olive Oil (enough to coat veggies) 
- Pizza Seasoning 

Instructions: 
• Preheat oven to 350 °F. 
• Put all veggies in large bowl and add oil and pizza seasoning and toss until evenly coated. 
• Put into baking dish and cover with parchment paper and aluminum foil. 
• Cook for 1 to 2 hours (or until veggies are soft - it is different each time). 

That is the recipe, and Id appreciate any tips that would help to get all the veggies cooked evenly. Thanks!

Boil and simmer, then add 3oz gin, and chill.

I made it for years with walnuts. 5 yrs ago I switched to dried fruit when I passed a kidney stone and the doctor said ""no nuts for you"". Nuts, dried fruit, chocolate chips and broken Whoppers are all good. However; I love cherries.
I do everything by hand. I use a Danish dough whisk, stiff silicone spatula and two large bowls. Set out 3 lg eggs to warm up. →dry ingredients: whisk 3 cups AP flour, ¼tsp salt and 1 tsp baking powder together in one bowl. →wet bowl: whisk 1 cup white sugar with ⅞ cup of canola oil. Add one egg at a time. Add 1tsp/½ T of extract. I use either vanilla or orange. I also add a couple packets of True Orange if I'm using dried cranberries. Add your dry ingredients into the wet stuff a bit at a time. Once it's Incorporated, use a spatula to mix in a cup of whatever you're putting in it.
Cover with Saran and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours. I often make the batter in the morning and bake cookies after dinner.
I use a large lipless cookie sheet and cover it with parchment paper. PREHEAT OVEN TO 350° Divide the dough in four. Roll them in your hands. I then place them on the parchment and shmoodgie them to reach from end to end across the width of the sheet. I've cleaned out spice containers. I have sugar in one and cinnamon in another. I sprinkle the tops of the logs/breads before baking them for 25 minutes. Remove them when the 25 minutes are up.
Turn off the oven and crack open the door. Let them cool for 10 minutes. Once cooled, carefully slide a spatula under them to free them from the parchment paper. Slide the nearest log onto a cutting board. Cut them about 1"" wide. Put them back onto the sheet on their sides. Preheat oven to 250°.
Bake them again for 20 minutes then flip them all over to the other side and put them back in for another 20 minutes. After that, turn all the cookies upside down and put them back into the cooling oven. This cures the cookies. This last step does two critical things. 1)It dries out the cookies so they could last up to a month. 2)It transforms them from tasting good to being ""OMG, these are delicious!""",0

202,Cooking,"I've been cooking for my family for years, and I cook all kinds of dishes, but I've kind of developed a typical style of meals and flavor profile that I always return to (and tbh, usually regret when I veer too far from).

That said, last night I tried a recipe that I was unsure would work out well and....you guys, I think I'm in love. 😍  This is like when I discovered the glory of [one-pot meals](https://www.budgetbytes.com/one-pot-sausage-sun-dried-tomato-pasta) four years ago.

So the recipe I tried last night was [One-Pan Sweet Israeli Chicken](https://www.rachelphipps.com/2020/10/one-pan-sweet-israeli-chicken.html), with my notes:

**For the chicken**

* 8 skin on bone in chicken thighs
* 2 large sweet potatoes *(I used four)*
* 8 banana shallots *(I used regular shallots; apparently the banana ones are larger so you could probably double the number)*
* 8 large dates *(The best part! Don't leave these out!)*
* 2 bay leaves
* 4 sprigs thyme *(or 1 tsp dried, or 3/4 tsp ground)*
* 2 cinnamon sticks, crushed *(or 1 tsp ground)*
* sea salt and black pepper *(There's soy sauce in the sauce so you don't need too much salt - I used about 3/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper)*
* couscous, to serve *(We had it with mac 'n cheese instead because leftovers, and that was yummy too)*
* roughly chopped flat leaf parsley, to serve

**For the Sauce**

* 200ml (1/3 cup) red wine
* 4 tbsp runny honey
* 4 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tsp ground coriander
* 2 large garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 small nub fresh ginger, grated *(I don't know how much a ""small nub"" is so I just grated until I got bored)*

**Instructions**

Pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees (355 fahrenheit). Nestle the chicken thighs, sweet potato, cut into fingers, shallots, peeled and halved, and the dates, halved *(I quartered them)* and pitted in a shallow lidded casserole dish *(I didn't have one of these so I just used a cake pan with aluminum foil and it worked great)*. Nestle the bay leaf, thyme sprigs and the crushed cinnamon stick among the chicken pieces.

Whisk together all the sauce ingredients and pour it over the chicken. *(I didn't bother whisking it separately - just poured all of the sauce ingredients over the dish and mixed it up with my hands)* Season everything well with salt and pepper.
Clap on the lid *(or cover with aluminum foil!)* and cook the chicken for 25 minutes. Remove the lid and cook for a further 25 minutes. *(Chicken is done when it's about 145 - took me about five minutes extra)* Serve with the couscous, sprinkled with fresh parsley.",0

234,Cooking,"Limoncello and other citrus-cellos are pretty fantastic and not terribly hard or expensive to make. They just take a bit of time and a little skill.

**Making Limoncello**
Let's start with the basic recipe. Actually, let's start with what limoncello is.

Limoncello is an alcohol extraction of lemon zest essence combined with simple syrup. You soak lemon zest in alcohol, then add the simple syrup later.

**Step 1 - **

You'll need:

* 10 lemons
*  750 ml of everclear or high proof vodka
*  A big jar

Start with the lemons and use a sharp knife to cut the zest off. The really important part of making limoncello is that you **don't include the white part along with the zest** the white part is the pith. It's extremely bitter and will wreck the flavor of the limoncello. This process takes a while, and you might want to watch a show or hang out with someone who is also cutting the zest off of the lemons. If you have a prized extra sharp knife, now is the time to use it. If you have been neglecting your knives and need to sharpen them, maybe you should consider doing that first. If you've never had a sharp knife before, consider looking into getting one. They make cooking far more pleasurable.

Toss the zest into the jar, and when you've done all 10 lemons pour the everclear in.

Store the jar in a cool, dark place for two weeks. I've tried it for longer, but it doesn't really improve the flavor. In fact I think it might have made it a little more bitter. Two weeks is fine.

**Step 2 -**

Add simple syrup to the extraction.

Simple syrup is... simple to make. The basic recipe is a cup of water and a cup of white sugar, then heat it until it's dissolved. For this recipe I'd suggest doing two cups of water and sugar. Wait until it's cooled before adding to the alcohol extraction.

If you're using 90 proof everclear, I'd suggest doing a 50/50 mix of extraction and simple syrup. If you're using something lower proof, I'd suggest using a higher sugar to water ratio, and then using less syrup overall. This is a really great point to make this recipe your own. Some people like really sweet limoncello, while others don't like it too too sweet. I'd suggest adding the simple syrup up to a point, and then tasting to see if you think it needs more sweetness. Keep in mind the flavors will be powerful right now, and will balance out after sitting in the fridge for a few weeks. Don't balance sweet to bitter or strong flavors, balance sweet to the alcohol and lemony flavors. You can always add more simple syrup later, but you can't take it out.

At this point, leave the limoncello in the fridge for a few weeks. Some of the more bitter and astringent flavors will resolve and leave a very nice liqueur.

**Variants**

I've made grapefruit-cello and orange-cello as well as limoncello. I haven't messed with limes, but probably will at some point. I bet meyer lemons, pomelos, and satsumas would create some interesting results too. Grapefruits were a huge pain to collect zest from. Their zest layer is extremely thin and it was very difficult to get the zest without the white pith underneath. The end result was really interesting though. Not great on its own but added a very deep and complex flavor when used in mixed drinks. I think I used four big red grapefruits for the recipe. 

Orangecello was super easy. The zest was easy to get at, and made a very good and fragrant result. I added a vanilla bean sliced in half lengthwise during the extraction phase, and it was delicious in drinks and on ice cream.

**Cocktails** 

There are a ton of limoncello cocktails out there, so I'll only add a few simple ones that really exemplify the flavor of the liqueur.

Champagne and limoncello - throw a floater of limoncello on top of champagne. It's delightful.

Limoncello and Seltzer - mix 50/50 limoncello and seltzer, and serve on ice. Be sure to add a squeeze of lemon as well, because the sour flavor really helps to bring out the other flavors in the drink.

**Other notes**

I had some really great results mixing the grapefruit- and orange-cello together. The strong flavors and sweet flavors between the two balanced each other very nicely.",0

Au jus by definition is supposed to be just the drippings from cooking the meat, but every video I have watched onine has the meat slow cooked in the oven and there's barely any liquid at all produced underneath (which I presume to be a good thing).

I just moved to an apartment and in my first week here I set off the smoke alarm trying to cook a steak on a stainless steel pain, with all my windows open and the range hood fan on the max - good way to introduce myself to the building hey.

So I went to investigate why this has happened and there were a few things that confused me with the range hood setup.

[https://i.imgur.com/fhN5A2X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/fhN5A2X.jpg)  
Here is the range hood setup, I'm assuming it's a vented one since well there's a big chimney going up into the ceiling somewhere.

[https://i.imgur.com/OjRoZP1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/OjRoZP1.jpg)  
The weird part is, there are two holes here and I have no idea what they are for. On top of that, they have some sort of really thick sticker/laminate on top of them to block them off. What the hell is going on here?

[https://i.imgur.com/QQmEsyW.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QQmEsyW.jpg)  
Here is what it looks like with the metal filters taken off, there are two square charcoal filters, I removed one to test the ventilation:  
[https://i.imgur.com/hOaJjwA.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/hOaJjwA.jpg)  
And you can see the side with no charcoal filter sucks enough air that the tissue sticks, but on the other side with the filter the tissue just flops down.

I guess I have two questions, the first is what is with the two holes, should I unblock them or something?

And the second question is, does it just look like those charcoal filters need replacing? Also wondering if I can just run boiling water or vinegar through them or something to clear them up, or if that will ruin them, only because the Fisher &amp; Paykel filters seem to be $53 and they're also out of stock on the website, and I can't find them at any local stores.",0

My family do this every year, it's our tradition, but it's the first since I got into cooking 😆 And I wanted to treat my parents some good food! 

When we did these before, we started with K-BBQ (brought Kimchi, Pork Belly, cooked rice and different ssam sauces from home).

I was excited that I got to introduce them to Jufran Banana Sauce! For those of you unfamiliar, it's a banana-based ketchup developed in the Philippines during WW2 tomato shortages. You can find it at most Asian specialty grocers in my experience. 

Of course the other big tomato-based condiment is BBQ sauce, which usually has ketchup as the primary base. I wondered what would happen if you tried to make BBQ sauce using banana ketchup. I googled and I found other attempts at a nightshade-free BBQ sauce, usually something complicated involving aminos and balsamic vinegar and a vegetable puree. What happens though if you just take a regular ass BBQ sauce recipe and substitute tomato ketchup with banana ketchup? I found no answers so I decided to experiment and find out myself. 

The basic recipe I used here was the Kansas City style BBQ sauce on Serious Eats: https://www.seriouseats.com/sauced-kansas-city-style-barbecue-sauce-recipe

Here are some images of the sauce I made: https://imgur.com/a/nwD5ccC 

There are some other issues. This recipe calls for mustard, and I'm aware some mustards might contain paprika which is apparently a nightshade concern. I used Grey Poupon dijon mustard because it was what I had on hand, some light googling makes me pretty sure it is nightshade-free. This recipe also calls for chili powder and cayenne... both are fine if you're just allergic to tomatoes, but again might cause problems for a general nightshade allergy. I divided my sauce into two batches, one with chili/cayenne and one without, to get an idea of how much difference it makes. 

The results were really good. I did a blind taste test where I had my mom try (#1) a decent KC-style store-bought sauce from Stew Leonard's, then (#2) the plain banana version, then (#3) the banana plus the chili/cayenne. She said she thought the banana versions were smoother and less astringent but also tasted a little more corn syrup-y (they do not contain corn syrup). She definitely could not tell that any of the versions contained bananas. Her favorite was #3, but she said that both #2 and #3 were overwhelmingly better than #1. I feel like I can safely say this turned out well.

Put the butter in the pan, turn the heat up high.  Wait for it to melt and add the apples, toss them around a bit to coat with butter.  Wait longer than you think you should, stir, and if you see some good dark browning, turn the heat down to medium-low.  Add the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Toss around to distribute the spice, then cook a bit longer until the sugar has melted and the apples are about as firm as a fresh tomato.

Through luck I will get my hands on a real french capon (2,5-3,5kg) on Christmas. And the friend who is visiting us for Christmas will arrive with a black périgord truffle. It will be glorious, but we're still discussing plans. 

So far I want to:

- pre-cook the capon sous vide with truffle under the skin (1 hour at 80° C and 4 hours at 74°

- then bake it at 210° C for another hour to get a crispy skin

My questions:

- does this sound dumb? I want to avoid the capon getting dry at all costs. Do you think low temperature in the oven would be better? 

- My friend has her heart set on a stuffing for the capon. Do you think baking the stuffing an hour is enough? What kind of stuffing do you suggest to go with the truffle? Right now I am leaning towards bread + smoked goose (can't do bacon because we're in kosher-ish.",0

2. Low heat brine frozen chicken with spices - (I believe this is food safe?) Whenever I need to cook chicken, whether it's braai/bbq or plain roasting and I forgot it in the freezer then just pop it in a warm pot of brine with a few spices (bay leaves, chili, etc.).

I am choosing to pasteurize the eggs as this isn't just for me, but I won't have any cream until tomorrow but it takes forever to cool a huge batch down so I need to pasteurize tonight and cool overnight (plus the grated nutmeg gets more time to impart flavour).

My question is, do you think it will matter if I pasteurize everything but the cream and then add it tomorrow?

I am running out of time so I'm hoping this will work

Day 1

- 6 egg yolks

- 3 cups whole milk
- 2 tsp grated nutmeg

bring to simmer and back to cold

For the mushroom broth:

1 package of dried chanterelle mushrooms

1 package dried shitake mushrooms

6 cups of water (or chicken stock)

8 ounces of cremini mushrooms

8 ounces of white mushrooms

2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil

2 tablespoons of butter

1 small white onion, finely chopped

2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped

1 cup of chopped celery

1 cup of chopped carrots

a sprinkle of salt and pepper

a few sprigs of fresh thyme

bay leaf




For the soup


2 Tbs. unsalted butter

2 Tbs. olive oil

1/2 medium onion, cut into medium dice (to yield about 3/4 cup cups)

2 shallots sliced

2 cloves garlic, minced

1/2 cup celery diced

1 package of dried morel mushrooms

1 lb. fresh wild mushrooms, wiped clean, trimmed (stems removed from shiitakes), and thinly sliced (to yield about 4-1/2 cups) (or about 3 oz dried wild mushrooms)

2 Tb. plus 1 tsp. fresh thyme leaves (8 sprigs tied with string) (or marjoram)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

4 cups homemade or low-salt chicken or vegetable broth (or mushroom broth in this recipe)

1/4 cup half-and-half or up to half cup crème fraîche

3 -6 Tbs. dry sherry, brandy and/or madera

1 Tbs. soy sauce


bay leaf

Directions
Make the mushroom broth:

Place dried mushrooms into small bowls and fill with boiling water/chicken stock. Let mushrooms steep for 20 minutes. Strain, adding the liquid to a measure containing the 5 cups of water.

Place the soaked mushrooms into a food processor fitted with a blade attachment along with the cremini and white mushrooms. Pulse to finely chop. Transfer chopped mushrooms to a bowl.

Place butter and oil into a large soup pot on medium-high heat. When the butter melts and everything starts bubbling, add the onion, garlic, celery and carrots. Stir, cover and cook for 5 minutes or until vegetables are soft.
Add the chopped mushrooms, the mushroom-steeping liquid and a few sprigs of thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer and cook for 20 minutes.

When the broth is cooked, strain and reserve the liquid for the soup. Discard the mushrooms and vegetables.

Make the wild mushroom soup:

Hydrate any dried mushrooms in broth from above 1 cup of liquid per every ½ ounce of mushrooms

Melt the olive oil in a 5-qt. or larger stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and shallots and cook until it’s beginning to brown (resist the urge to stir too often), about 4 minutes. Add the celery, fresh mushrooms, and 1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper; cook until the mushrooms become limp, 2 to 4 minutes up to 10-15 min total for onions and mushrooms.

Stir in the butter and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add 2 TBS flour and continue to stir for another 3 minutes to make the roux.

Deglaze with some of the cognac, sherry or Madera here if desired

Add 2 Tbs. of the thyme and rehydrated mushrooms to pot (reserve some mushrooms for searing for garnish).

Add the broth, in stages, scraping up any browned bits in the pot with a wooden spoon. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, and cook until the mushrooms are tender, 7 to 10 minutes or up to 20 min to thicken. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

Transfer about half of the soup to a stand blender and process until smooth. Return the mixture to the pot.

In a separate medium sized bowl add the cream or crème fraîche and place one cup of the hot soup mix in the bowl and stir. This will temper the cream and keep it from curdling.

Place the cream mix back into the soup and stir in the sherry, and soy sauce. Add more salt and pepper to taste, if needed, bringing back to a simmer for another 10 minutes.

If using Morels, remove from liquid, strain and stir liquid into soup. Place Morels in soup bowls and ladle soup over them.

Garnish each serving with a small pinch of the remaining 1 tsp. thyme. Perhaps drizzle olive oil, dab crème fraîche and serve some crusty bread.

For a topping, squeeze the reserved mushrooms to eliminate any excess moisture. sauté them in butter an oil until browned and season them with salt and pepper.",0

As a long-time sushi lover, I have tried make sushi/uramaki at home several times, often with good results both in terms of taste and in terms of presentation. But one thing is always off: despite buying my salmon from a good supermarket or from a good fishmonger and having tried both fresh, ""sushi"", and slightly smoked salmon, I never seem to be able to get my salmon to taste exactly like the one I get from my usual sushi restaurant.

First of all, the texture of my salmon is a lot less firm compared to the sashimi I get in restaurants and, secondly, the taste is always ""more fresh"" as in, it tastes more like ""salmon"" and less like ""sushi salmon"" (this sentence doesn't make much sense, but I am not sure how to explain it).

Do restaurants buy some specific salmon? From a specific place? A specific cut? Do they pre-process it somehow? 

I also know there is no such thing as ""sushi-grade"" salmon and that for safety reasons the salmon should be frozen at very low temperature and long enough to kill the parasites, and I always make sure to ask if the salmon I'm buying is suitable for eating raw.",0

I'm planning an Italian Christmas Eve Menu that includes the following: 

* Fresh bread with roasted garlic to spread on it
* Baked brie with cranberry chutney and pecans
* A rib meat stuffed pasta ravioli
* Espresso and dark chocolate cheesecake with pinwheel cookie crush

I want to use the recipe from this site: [https://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/chuck-hughes/short-rib-ravioli-and-creamy-mushroom-sauce-2012701](https://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/chuck-hughes/short-rib-ravioli-and-creamy-mushroom-sauce-2012701)

I'm worried, however, that the new pasta filling with be too rich with a brown butter sauce. I don't think a red sauce would work, either, because I'm worried it would overpower the delicate flavors in the rib meat base.

419,Cooking,"Hi all! We have a “Drunken Pork” recipe in my family that is so so delicious except one issue: the pork rarely comes out moist.
It’s really fine because there is a delicious sauce that comes from the cooking process, but I’m curious if there are any suggestions for tweaking the recipe! Here’s the gist:

It uses a “pork loin top loin roast.” It’s a cylindrical roast tied up with butcher twine, seasoned with seasoned salt, and I put slices of garlic throughout in small slits i make with a knife.

Olive oil to coat the bottom of a Dutch oven
Sauté a heaping tbsp minced garlic, a few shredded carrots, and a chopped shallot

Push the softened veg aside, Sear the pork roast on all sides. 
Place cut up russet potatoes in the remaining space around the pork, top with a  sprig of fresh rosemary, and pour in a whole bottle of dry white wine. 
After bringing it to a boil i reduce to a lesser boil and cook it for around 45 mins then flip it and cook for another 30 or so.

I check the pork and take it out around 140°. Then I let it rest in foil and keep the potatoes cooking until they are tender and the sauce has thickened. 
 
It’s always phenomenal, but the pork is usually dry! Would finishing it off in the oven help?
Would that affect the potatoes ability to cook as well? 

Any advice is appreciated!!",0

429,Cooking," 

I have been making a fair amount of mayo at home lately, and I've realized that you can really dial in on the final texture of it when you're hand-whisking it.

I typically make a very stiff ""base"" of one yolk, a bit of water, a bit of salt, a bit of mustard, and enough oil to make it so that it stands stiffly upright on an upturned whisk. From there, I'll add my acidic liquid-y ingredients, such as lemon juice or wine vinegar, which then makes the mayo less stiff.

Last night, though, I overdid it on my liquidy components and made it so that the final mayo was practically pourable, rather than stiff enough to hold itself up. Which got me thinking, *is it better as a shmear-able sauce or as something that runs a bit?*

Coming to you with quite a bizarre question - with the holidays coming up, I have been trying to perfect mashed potatoes as they're always a crowd pleaser, but I am running into a fact that has me stumped.   


For regular mashed potatoes I pretty much use the J.Kenji Lopez-Alt recipe and they're awesome. I've made a few very very minor changes to get the consistency I like, but that's about it.    
[https://www.seriouseats.com/ultra-fluffy-mashed-potatoes-recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/ultra-fluffy-mashed-potatoes-recipe)  
Then comes yesterday - a super busy day where I haven't had the time to eat pretty much anything, so I grabbed one of those instant mashed potato packages to go alongside some grilled chicken. I get home, fully expecting the mash to be mediocre at best, so I remixed the recipe on the package to be essentially exactly the same as the Kenji recipe, only switching out potatoes for the flakes. I sit down to eat and that's when the confusion hits me - it legit tastes so much better and more potatoey.  


Thinking that it must've been me just starving yesterday, I do the same thing - switch out water for milk, add butter etc, and again - it's so much better than what I usually make.  
It's not even the texture or anything like that - I use a ricer, so it's pretty much identical, but it's the taste itself that is better.   


So here I am asking - have I been too snobby to ever consider using them and am only now discovering that it's actually an amazing shortcut or am I doing something very very wrong?",0

Now onto the long post. If you are wondering, as I was earlier this year, whether Hello Fresh is a decent enough subscription; this post is for you.

Why use it at all?

We use Hello Fresh as a going out alternate. I like cooking and enjoy eating well. 

Are the portions big enough? Will it stretch?

I prefer to order 2X3 meals. How often I order depends on credits, special occasions or the fact that we want to eat something fancy. We find the portion sizes generous and, more often than not, we have some leftovers. A few specific recipes, we have been able to stretch it to cover an additional meal for two adults. 

I can get the ingredients for cheap...

Yes, you can. But more often than not, we get recipes which we wouldn't normally eat. They require a tiny amount of special ingredients, something that is usually not possible to buy. I prefer to try a recipe, and if we agree the recipe was great, I add the ingredient to my pantry and cook the recipes again. I usually order only when I have credits/free boxes. 

Anything else?

A few things...

I like the recipe cards that come and have saved each one of them. They make repeating a dish and shopping for it easy. However, it must be said SimplyCook recipe cards are better and have a strip with ingredients that you can take along while shopping.",0

522,Cooking,"Hi all,

I don’t know why everyone complains about turkey leftovers during the holidays - we make one for ourselves each year just to enjoy in salads, sandwiches, and sometimes soups after the fact.  I normally do a breast only, but this year I’ve decided to go all in with a full turkey.  I’m guessing the logistics are a bit different with limbs attached and I’ve been researching online.  Given the widespread fear of dry turkey, I thought I’d better ask the experts, or at least the experienced lol.  

First off, I have found a suggestion to cook the turkey breast-down because the fats from the dark meat will leak down onto the breast and keep it moist.  The recipe said to flip the turkey over for the last 45 min of cook time to give a traditional browning.  I’ve had chicken that someone cooked breast-side down and it did not cook evenly and was raw in the center and had to be placed back into the oven, which burnt the outsides.  Any idea how this would play out with a turkey?

Second, should I dry brine if the turkey has been pre-brined in a 9% solution?  I feel like there would be some benefit to allowing the turkey to sit and soak in the flavors of herbs and citrus zest.  Maybe I should just do a standard rub with low salt and let it soak it in? 

Are all citrus created equal in the eyes of the turkey?  I normally use oranges and lemons but I’m seeing that some people swear by clementines.  Also, any suggestion as far as seasonings would be helpful as well to pair with the preferred citrus.  There seems to be a bit of difference in the recipes I’m seeing between what one would season a turkey with as opposed to a chicken and I’m not sure where the disconnect lies.

- Beef and beetroot borsch, for the main dish
- Olivier salad
- Black bread
- Georgian grilled eggplant with walnut-pomegranate sauce
- Syrniki (cottage cheese pancakes), for dessert

So the theme is mostly eastern European / caucuses cuisine.

Can anybody suggest one or two more sides to me? The menu could use more veggies (bonus if they're leafy), but not something that takes mad effort like cabbage rolls / sarma. It can include (but shouldn't be exclusively) meat, and it would hopefully not be too carb-heavy because the bread and potato salad would be nuff starch to go around.",0

## Chọn chế độ dinh dưỡng cân bằng cho mèo

Giáo sư về dinh dưỡng của trường đại học thú y Minnesota ở St. Paul,  Julie A. Churchill cho biết, “Mèo ăn không nhiều và thường tỏ ra khó chịu khi chọn lựa thức ăn, vậy nên bạn cần tập cho chúng thói quen dùng thức ăn dinh dưỡng từ nhỏ để đảm bảo sức khỏe của mèo về lâu dài”.

Ông Richard Hill, giáo sư tại trường đại học thú y Florida ở Gainesville cho hay:

“Một điều cần lưu ý là tất cả các người chủ nuôi mèo đều nên biết cách đọc hiểu thông tin trên bao bì thức ăn cho mèo.

Hiện nay các thương hiệu quảng cáo tràn lan về chất lượng nhưng không có nền tảng chất dinh dưỡng từ những nghiên cứu về yếu tố quyết định sức khỏe trong thức ăn dành cho mèo.

Hơn nữa, một số nhãn hiệu chỉ ghi qua loa về nguyên liệu chứ không đề cập đến chất dinh dưỡng sau đó như lượng protein và chất béo, hai trong số những yếu tố quan trọng nhất tác động đến sức khỏe chung của mèo.”

Baked russet potatoes have been a staple in my diet for a long time and I'd consistently get perfect results at my old place baking at 400F for 40-50min depending on size. All I normally do is scrub the exterior, poke several holes in the skin, and plop them on a baking tray.

If I try to bake at this temperature now, it takes roughly 80-90 minutes to pass the poke test and reach ~210F internal temp. What the heck could possibly DOUBLE the cooking time?

I have an oven thermometer confirming the temperature in the oven and a probe thermometer for the potatoes. I've tried several different batches of potatoes from different sources with the same results. I've considered humidity and elevation but those are both very similar between the two locations. 

The last thing I can think is my old oven was electric and my current is gas. I tested for hotspots by moving the thermometer around and by baking a tray of breadcrumbs but didn't find anything significant. I also tried rotating the potatoes as they cooked, but to no avail. Is it simply the additional moisture in a gas oven causing cooking times to skyrocket?

The potatoes taste perfectly fine when they finally DO reach an acceptable temperature/consistency; I'm just at a complete loss as to what's happening here.

I'm making Shepherd's Pie for a small holiday gathering tomorrow. 
But I've never been the biggest fan of the dish honestly, and I've been trying to think of ways to make it better/more interesting. I'd love to get y'all's advice. 

Do you have any ideas for variations on the dish that jazz it up a bit?
One of my biggest critiques is that the meat (or lentil) filling is often a homogenous texture and taste, so particularly I'm looking for ideas on that part, not necessarily the potatoes. (The internet already has a million and one potato variations, but the filling is almost always the same).

To start things off, I've been considering the merits of the following veg instead of peas and carrots:

--spinach (or kale?)
--green beans?
--parsnips 
--mushroom medley
--carmelized onion
--one recipe i found called for asparagus but that seems like a strong flavor

Would it be weird to include some sort of nut, like maybe pinenut, as a textural element and to add some earthy sweetness?

For the meat, what could be used other than ground beef or lamb? Maybe like a stew meat if it's broken down first, kinda like a pot roast? Would adding in some sausage to the ground beef be good, or is it too fatty? 

Most recipes call for tomato paste and wine as the main flavoring ingredients for the gravy. What are other flavor profiles that could be used? My grandmother uses Lipton soup mix powder for making Jewish style braised brisket, and I had a thought that it might be tasty to throw some of that in there.

The thing is: lemon peels. I think they're great if cooked a lot. They seem to lose a lot of the bitterness from the whites if cooked enough, though you can use a knife and cut off the zest, discarding the whites. 

To me this is a game changer.",0

660,Cooking,"I am upgrading my families culinary experience. I have a cast iron that I use from time to time. Usually for meat or hash browns. I am ordering a new induction range and because none of my calphalon non stick cookware is magnetic, it is all being rehomed. Moving forward I’ll be using exclusively stainless steel, cast iron, and carbon steel. 

Because 99% of my cooking has been done on non stick cookware my technique is crap and I lack the knowledge of what should be cooked in which vessel. 

What I’m expecting from what I’ve read on this sub:

It seems that most of you describe stainless steel as good “all purpose” cookware. Because of this I purchased a reasonably priced cuisinart set for general purposes. I know I’ll need to do tomato based dishes here. But I’ll be honest I’m not too familiar with stainless. I know it CAN do meat. But be prepared to handle the stick. So I’m not sure what other types of dishes would do well in stainless

As for cast iron I know that it does a great job crisping and browning. Therefore I’ve used it mostly for it for meat and potatoes. But moving forward (after I season it better) cast iron will have to be taking over as my non stick. I see a lot of fried egg videos of people flexing their non stick but how does cast iron seasoning hold up to scrambled eggs?

As for carbon steel I’ve never used one, but look forward to seeing how it interacts. I’m imagining that carbon steel would be good for a dish that I want in the cast iron without the hassle of cleaning out the cast iron. ie: Hamburger helper. (Carbon steel appears easier to clean out post meal, or am I wrong?)

Edit:Why am I getting downvoted so badly... You don't have to downvote me or upvote me. I wasn't bragging, I was just weirded out. It's nice to know that I'm not weird, I suppose

Also I realized today the reason why such small cans of meat have so many servings. Because when you add other ingredients to them like vegetables and fruits, you get quite a hearty and hefty meal.

This can be a huge problem with chicken breasts, cause even if I buy the boneless/skinless ones I still have to do surgery on each breast for 5+ minutes to remove fat and tendons and stuff. It makes cooking with chicken absolutely miserable and so I almost never do it, but I'd like to, you know, actually be able to cook a meat that I like. And that's the rub, too, I know it shouldn't take that long to trim each breast but since I can rarely ever bring myself to cook with it cause of the sensory issues I don't have any chance to practice and bring that time down.

So, yeah, do they sell pre-trimmed chicken breasts or do we somehow still not have that technology yet?

673,Cooking,"Coming from the perspective of a broke college student, cookbooks are really freaking expensive--like they're an investment. The issue I often find is that when buying a cookbook you don't actually know if that cookbook is going to vibe with your style of cooking until you try it out (ie. how many ingredients you regularly purchase are included in the recipes, how many ingredients you'd have to go out of your way to buy and then never use again, the time and effort needed to make something, whether you like the overall taste of the dishes, etc), you know what I mean? I've especially found with some of the really big name cookbooks, like *The Food Lab* most of those recipes are waaaaay out fo my price range and would make me buy ingredients I almost never have or would use again--but there's still some cool recipes in there that I'd love to try out! My library has like 9 copies of it (even some online copies!), so that makes it way more doable to take a copy of *The Food Lab* out for a few weeks, try the recipes I was interested in and then give it back when time's up.

I know a lot of people just say why not use online recipes and stuff, which yeah, I do, but I also really appreicate the immense insight and often intense testing each recipe goes through to get into a recipe book--it's nice to see the fruition of the author's efforts in one place and there's something nostalgic about having to find a way to prop up a recipe book on the counter :) Anyways, if you're debating about a cookbook, try searching your local library branch first--you might be surprised!

**TL;DR libraries are an accessible and** ***free*** **way of trying out cookbooks**

Edit: I'm so happy to see so many of you doing this too! I definitely feel like I was a little behind with the times since I only just realized this was a possibility LOL 

Some other cool tips people have mentioned that I wanted to highlight:

* If your library doesn't have a book you're looking for, you can try an inter-library loan to get books available in other districts
* Hoopla (US), Libby (US and UK), and One Drive (Canada) are free resources you can sign up for with your library card to get access to ebooks

674,Cooking,"I've had a gift card for Penzey spices for over 2 years now and finally decided to use it no matter what and for some reason I bought two pounds of 4-in cinnamon sticks. 

I thought that it would be fun to use  as drink stirrers for hot chocolate and cider over the holidays but I had not really considered how many cinnamon sticks are in a 2 lb bag.

I have ideas on how to use cinnamon sticks by grating them into cookies that I'm baking but that is not going to use nearly enough of them fast enough. So really, I'm looking for suggestions on how to use them in bulk at this point or suggestions on how to best store these cinnamon sticks if I'm not able to use them fast enough.

Any  advice would be greatly appreciated.

Are these meant to be used for some kind of specific purpose? I don't do a lot of fancy cooking, I just want to make chicken thighs or eggs on the stove without clean-up being a nightmare.

676,Cooking,"I make my chili without beans and usually with plenty of meat. Every time I do, no matter how long it simmers, it always comes out like as a nice thick mass of chili goodness, but with a residue of watery broth. It’s almost as if the chili separates from the liquid. Is there anything I can do to bind it more? 

I had heard that meat makes something more watery, and perhaps that’s why mine always comes out that way? But even still, that wouldn’t explain things since I simmer for so long. 

For the record, the ingredients I use are: meat, onion, pepper, tomatoes, seasoning.

677,Cooking,"I recently made sticky toffee pudding and it was absolutely delicious. I saw that in Cupcake Jemma's recipe, she also made a creme Anglaise to go along with it. I want to try this since my brother is coming home soon and I want to make it for him.

I have three main questions:

1. Can I make the creme anglaise in advance? How long does it stay fresh/what is the best way to store it?
2. After steeping the milk with a vanilla bean, what can I do with the bean? It kills me to just throw it away. I have a jar of homemade vanilla extract but since the vanilla bean will be covered in milk, is it worth it to rinse it and just stick it back in the jar? or is there something more useful I can do with it?
3. Also what do you guys think of infusing the milk mixture with vanilla AND cinnamon? do you think it will be too much? will it overpower the vanilla?

The recipe I plan to use is:

200ml Whole Milk

200ml Double Cream  (I'm American so I guess I'll just use heavy cream?)

1/2 Vanilla Pod (or Vanilla Extract)

3 Egg Yolks  30g Caster Sugar

Edi: Thanks for your answers. It seems it's the same thing then. In the UK we never abreviate it but maybe that's due to it not being a common enough dish. If you asked for a bowl of chili in the UK you'd probably get a bowl of chilli peppers!

Obviously, the mercury consumption is worth being concerned about. There is no safe level of mercury, and the recommendations for minimizing the risk and incredibly sad. Some recommendations only permit a pitiful serving of tuna a couple of times a week.

The instructions on the package say 18 - 22 minutes PER LB, which works out to be almost twice as long (the temperatures are similar).

What should I do? I don't want to serve overcooked goose but I'm also not keen on undercooked either. Medium rare sounds fine as long as it's safe. One hour seems short (15 min/kg) though as it normally takes me 2 to 3 hours to cook a 5 - 6 lb duck.

So I decided to make and bottle chilli jams for Christmas gifts for the first time in ages but when I came back to it this morning I noticed it was more like a syrup than a jam (I'll put the recipe below so you can see where I went wrong). 

I like the flavour of it but ideally want to either A. Put it back on the hob and attempt to get a better consistency or B. Transfer it into bottles and use as a sauce, issue is I'm not sure if this can be done safely after sealing. 

Once you've jarred and sealed jams can you heat them again and put them back in freshly sterilised jars or is that risky? - really don't want to be gifting sickness for Christmas :/ 

For a little context this was the recipe: 
-10 deseeded chillis
-3 roasted red peppers
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 500g jam sugar
- 500 ml of cider vinegar
(I also added a small handful of roasted tomatoes, dash of lemon juice and some orange zest) 

Once blended the mix was put in a pan with a bit of salt, the pectin sugar and vinegar (and 2 pricked scotch bonnets). Boiled it up and let it reduce until silky (about 35 mins on a medium/high heat). Then into jars and sealed.

710,Cooking,"Hello everyone! Just found out about this sub due to my growing passion for cooking and looking forward to a career in this domain.

A little bit about me: 22M. I did (struggled through) 3 years of Computer Science and realised it's not for me.

Until this moment, I was a really introvert boy and pretty fat (huge food lover) Meanwhile, I redescovered myself and improved a lot (not only physically, but mentally too) when I got into fitness and weightlifting. By doing this, I also wanted to prep my own food to eat healthier/be careful about macros/etc.

At this point, I have also seen the joy of cooking, not only eating. So I've started going a little easier on my diets, since I got in shape, and started practicing on many dishes.

And I found out that I thoroughly enjoyed every last bit of it: from the onion chopping to the plating.

So I've thought a lot about becoming a chef so I've looked into what this career means (seen how hard it is and sacrifices you have to make, which didnt really unmotivate me). I was also watching some culinary tv show's audition from my country and got hooked up with some of the contestants' journeys to becoming cooks. I kinda think I fit the criteria to start working in this industry.

- I dont mind hard work, especially the kitchen one. Physical condition is not a problem. I know what I'll do the first time I set foot into a kitchen and I'm totally prepared.
- I like working in a militarised-ish environment. I'm not very good socially speaking (far from being antisocial, but I really like focusing and working hard when I'm at the job). I mean, I also dont have many friends and I'm still kinda introvert haha.
- I dont have a lot of expectations pay wise. Sure, I want to have a nice salary when I'll take a higher position, but I'm ok with the limited money. I'm the smallest spender I know.

I have 2 options: struggle to work in a bigger city (capital actually) next to mine and look for a nicer (maybe even fine dining) restaurant to work in, prefferably under a known chef to learn a lot OR since I have zero experience, looking for a nice restaurant (we have nothing fine dining or at this level) in my city will suffice for now?

I also wanna do a good culinary school after 6 months of work and then look to establish myself in the capital and start working at a good restaurant. After this, I wanna leave to other countries and learn there a lot more (hopefully a michelin restaurant too, who knows?). I wanna get better and better and I wanna start young.

728,Cooking,"So I'm currently remaking something I made and really liked a couple weeks ago I lovingly nicknamed Abomination Chili. 

In a decent sized crockpot I added a large can of sloppy joe sauce (because I thought it had meat in it too) and continued despite that. So I added a couple medium sized cans of kidney beans, a medium sized can of Hormel beanless chili, a can of peeled tomatoes I cut up, and then browned 2 lbs of turkey sausage in a health stick of butter and then added mushrooms before adding them to the chili. Add in some beef broth, onion powder, and some red chili flakes and I let it set for about 8 hours. 

It was spicy, but with a dollop of sour cream it was a delicious chili. Even without the sour cream it was good. 

So now we get to the title. Would it be a good idea to add carrots to this chili? I was thinking of slicing them into disks. I like soft carrots, but I know carrots can go too soft and kind of turn to mush in a good long slow cook. If I do add them, should it be like an hour before serving/Tupperwaring?

I don't see carrots in chili often, so I thought it would fit the title of abombination chili. 

If I had to guess on the proportions (and googling for canned proportions) I'll list them below. 

1. 2lbs 85% lean ground turkey
2. 1 regular stick of butter
3. 16 ounces sliced brown mushrooms
4. 24 oz can of sloppy joe sauce
5. 14.5 oz canned peeled tomatoes (drained in the sink, I didn't add the tomato juice)
6. 2 16oz cans of kidney beans (drained before adding)
7. 15oz beanless chili (which may or may not be meant to be a chip dip)
8. At most a 1/2 cup of onion powder, at least a third. I know it sounds like a lot... Probably because it is. 
9. Maybe 2 tablespoons of chili flakes. I just kind of sprinkled it over the chili before stirring with the pour end open. I didn't do it accidentally. I think my thought process was 'chili is normally spicy, so this seems right'. I don't think it was more than two tablespoons. Probably closer to 1 tablespoon and 1 or 2 teaspoons. 
10. 15-25oz Beef Broth. Again, I could middle ground this but it was enough to make it appropriately liquidy. 

In the cooking I went about it probably wrong (based on the recipes I looked up in trying to recreate this) where I started by making the chili sauce, then added the meat, then seasoned with the powder and flakes. 

All opinions welcome, thank you anyone who read that whole mess.

735,Cooking,"I used Babish's recipe for jalapeno cheddar cornbread. I've cooked it before and it's been fine. But now I have a new cast iron pan, quite a large cast iron pan. So I doubled the recipe to better fit the pan and shoved it in the oven for 425°F. I set the timer for the normal 25 min to check it's progress, it obviously wasn't done so I set it for 25 min again. I kept checking it after 15 min intervals and it wasn't getting done. The inside was still very squishy. Not a liquid or anything, maybe like a pudding. It took forever for it to really set and I ended up burning the top and having to cut it off so I could cook it longer. Should I have used a different temp? Is it just too much cornbread to cook at once?

739,Cooking,"Edit to add more details:

I made chili this last Friday using tri-tip leftover from Thanksgiving. I've been enjoying glorious chili meals for the last 5 days (RIP my wife and son) - were talkin' chili with cornbread, huevos rancheros, tater tots topped with chili. I've been reheating the chili each day to simmering/bubbling, adding new water, and then chilling again when done with the meal. The temp reaches and stays above 165f each time for more than 20 minutes. 

With all the outdoor decorating, tree cutting, and whatnot this season, the chili has been keeping me warm, full, and energized all weekend. 

Honestly, I know the end has come for this pot of spectacular, spicy brown gold. I was sort of curious to see how far one could theoretically take this safely and to get an idea of what others do to big pots of chili or stew. I've never had an issue doing it this way, or gotten food poisoning, but it seems I'm a little loose compared to others when it comes to food safety in my kitchen.

Cheers, I'm gonna go dump these leftovers and try not to shed a tear for all the joy it brought me.",0

I am going to make the dark sweet soy sauce since I already have all of its constituents.  So for the sauce (kecap manis, is it the same thing?) should I use palm sugar, brown sugar, or white sugar?

I think palm sugar could be more authentic, but that's not necessarily better in every case.  What are most people used to?  I would like to make it the way it is most commonly known and enjoyed.  I have not tried it before.

It would be good to finally use up some of the palm sugar, which I've had for a while now.

What do all of you prefer?


edit:  I made it, and it was awesome.
I adapted it from [this recipe](https://tasteasianfood.com/thai-basil-chicken/).
  
  
Mix in a small saucepan:  
1 and 1/2 T dark soy sauce  
2 and 1/2 T fish sauce  
1 T oyster sauce  
1/4 t ground white pepper  
4 T water  
16g palm sugar  
  
Corn starch mixture:  
1 t cornflour  
1 T water  
  
Others:  
2 T peanut oil  
1/2 medium size onion, sliced thinly  
500g chicken breast meat (one large chicken breast), diced into 1 cm cubes  
1 T minced garlic  
6 bird's eye chillies, sliced thinly  
3/4 cup Thai basil (or holy Thai, if you can get it)  
  
Garnish:  
1 bird's eye chilli, sliced  
1 green part of the green onion, sliced  
  
  
Method:  
Mix the ingredients for the sauce, and heat in a small saucepan until the sugar is melted.  Reserve.  
  
Swirl 2 T peanut oil until smoking in your wok, then turn off the heat and let it cool.  
  
Heat the wok over medium and cook the ungyons until some browning occurs.  Turn up the heat to high and  brown the chicken, about a minute and a half on two sides.  Add in the garlic and cook until aromatic.  
  
Pour in the sauce, corn starch mixture, and chillies,  and cook until thickened.  
  
Add in the basil and cook until wilted.
  
Garnish with the chilli and green onions and serve with rice.",0

My hard and fast rule for meat is it’s ok for a week and fridge uncooked, and a week cooked (sometimes those two rules combined). Anything older goes to the dog. I scrape mold off bread, cheese, the tops of old sauces. I eat home made raw egg mayonnaise up to 3 weeks after making. I drink raw milk past the expiration date with a taste test. 

I’ve only recently started to realize this isn’t normal. Some friends were disgusted when I mentioned I ate 6 month expired cream cheese.

I was at a Hunan market looking for fresh ginger, and they did not have any, but the shop owner reccomended this ginger powder: [https://savorygo.com/products/meizhiwei-ginger-powder-85-g-%E9%AD%85%E4%B9%8B%E5%91%B3-%E6%B2%99%E5%A7%9C%E7%B2%89](https://savorygo.com/products/meizhiwei-ginger-powder-85-g-%E9%AD%85%E4%B9%8B%E5%91%B3-%E6%B2%99%E5%A7%9C%E7%B2%89)

However, when I got home, I read on the back: ""this product must be cooked in boiling water above 100\*C for more than 20 minutes before serving"".

After researching, I understand that a common use for powdered ginger is to make tea, and this boiling is a natural part of the preparation. Unfortunately, I purchased this to substitute for fresh ginger in a recipe that won't work with ginger water. 

I would like to understand what is being achieved from a food-safety standpoint when one boils ginger powder. I am not one to willy-nilly disregard such instructions. But none of my searches came up with an explanation.

846,Braincels,"Reading through many Height vs Face arguments and reflecting on my own ethnic background, I think it depends on inter-racial dynamics. For example, a majority of South American men (Mexican/Chilean/etc) are quite short compared to white counterparts. Nonetheless, there is very little struggle for these shorter men from Latin heritage to get women from their OWN ethnic group. In this case, the face of the South American man is the one that is most important since height variance is minimal and the assumption for these men is to be naturally short. Therefore, face would presumably be valued greatly. Now, I believe it’s possible for the value of height to be increased when certain ethnic groups are dating outside their ethnic group. Returning to the example of the South American man, if men from these groups are seeking women who come from other ethnic backgrounds that are on average much taller, then it could be presumed that the value of height begins to increase. This is because this example of a man is being disadvantaged by height expectations of another ethnic group.",1

Back then I had successfully retardmaxxed and was somewhat low inhib so no one liked me at all. Having grown up since then I changed that and try hard to act as normal as possible but it's still a challenge due to being isolated so much throughout life.

This girl was with a friend who was also a girl and a stranger to me. The one I went to school with said hi to me and I said hello back. A few seconds later they were in a circle with some other people and I heard my name mentioned and saw the two looking at me from the corner of my eye. The one from school was whispering something to her friend, and when I looked at them, her friend got this weird look on her face, like she was disgusted and shocked. You know that wide eyed glare girls do? It was that look.

The girl from school was undoubtedly telling her friend that I'm some fucking crazy, creepy, retard or similar. I said nothing but ""hello"" and continued as I had since before they even showed up, not even paying attention to anyone until I saw them looking at me.

But still that girl decided to go out of her way to ruin my night, essentially poisoning the well on me before I even have a chance to interact with anyone, not that I would have anyway. Normies love to tell you to improve yourself and all that shit, but when you do, they still go out of their way to tell people who have never met you before how dumb you were almost a decade ago. They can't just leave you alone, even when you're an adult.

How is one supposed to grow or change as a person in an environment like that? Once normies find out you're different in some way, the only hope for you is to just pack up and move somewhere else and start over.

969,Braincels,"Nofap and cooming.

both are bad. sexual activity should be only for reproduction, otherwise you're just engaging in hedonism.

repeated and constant engagement in recreational orgasms (mostly through masturbation/porn consumption although it can definitely still happen through sex) leads to the advancement of sexual deviancy - i.e. kinks. This can range from harmless things like feet to legitimately dangerous desires like paedophilia or bug chasing. Nobody is born with a chemical imbalance that makes them desire the smell of a girl's farts.

By recognising this fact we can deduce that the majority of homosexuals, bisexuals, and all transsexuals are simply engaging in fetishes they've developed through years of porn consumption and/or recreational orgasms; this is why most LGBT 'discover' their sexual preferences some years after the beginning of puberty and why the number of LGBT individuals has risen alongside the availability of pornography. As someone who used to consider themselves bisexual, never in my childhood did I have a crush on a guy.

Think of all the energy that just goes into nutting - the resources poured into the production of pornography and sex toys. People have made entire fortunes producing condoms and other forms of contraception. I'd guess that at least a third of the media we consume is sex-related, and sex-related media often generates the highest commercial demand. And all for what? A couple seconds of pleasure and a quick dopamine release, and to top it all off you're not even using the organs for their intended function; no offspring has been created - a complete fucking waste of time, energy and brainpower.

The more of your mind that is dedicated to COOMING, the less enlightened you can be as your brain has less space or time to occupy itself with intellectual activities. Look at the great thinkers throughout history and count how few of them indulged in sex as a pastime. This is also one of the reasons why women are mentally inferior to men: as not only are they engaging in recreational sex more than most men, but their biology is much more dedicated to sex (look at their ability for multiple orgasms or the fact that their role is to gestate the fetus as the man goes out and works).",1
970,Braincels,"1. Ban makeup. All foids decrease SMV by 3 points, first step to fixing hypergamy. There is really no reason why makeup should be legal. Remember foids, your looks don’t matter, it’s all about your personality. Additionally it would be nice to limit premarital sex but there’s really no way to reasonably enforce that 

2. Make gender transition therapy/surgery etc. illegal to anyone under the age of 25. Ideally it would be illegal for everyone, but you have to be fair and give people some rights to freedom once they have reached a certain age and maturity. If they want to transition at 25 and rope soon after, their choice. Additionally, remove all mentions of LGBT+ rights from the media, less propaganda to encourage degeneracy. Ban gay pride parades. Sure, they can have equal rights but there needs to be some kind of don’t ask don’t tell system to prevent their degeneracy from spreading. Being a tranny/fag really seems to be becoming some kind of trend. Any violation = fines or prison, depending on what it is. Prescribing/providing a teenager estrogen = life in prison. Participating in a gay pride demonstration = $1000 fine or some shit. To be absolutely clear, I have no problem with LGBT people, I don’t think they should be treated poorly, but I believe that there are certain people with certain agendas to increase sexual degeneracy. Just live your lives and don’t talk about it.

3. Ban pornography and any kind of sex work. Controversial but necessary. We are raising generations of coomers who are replacing intimacy with porn or paid sex, and it simply doesn’t work as a long run solution. Plus the porn industry is corrupt as fuck, grooming immature and sometimes mentally unstable girls with promises of money and fame.

If normies want to have the tranquility of enjoying life in peace, they need to start to respect and being polite to one another.

1057,Braincels,"I’ve been off this subreddit for a while now, about a month, without posting or reading a single post, but I’m posting because many things have changed for me.

For one, I stopped feeling as much in a bubble, being on here made me much more depressed and hopeless. 

I’ve observed the fact that though my looks situation is not ideal, there are many, many very short men and/or weak chinned/jawlined and baby faced men that I encounter on the day to day, people who this subreddit would classify as an incel would easily make up above 30% of the male population, however, we know this not to be the case.

I’ve also seen many good looking men who would qualify as chadlites who are struggling with getting a girlfriend and even one night stands, as though social skills matter to some degree. 

There are over 3.5 billion females in the world. Do you really think that in a world where 10% of the population (male and female) are homosexual, there’s people who are into bestiality, even fucking scat, the relative frequency of a female who is capable of being interested in you is below 0%? Anyone who understands simple statistics knows this is impossible. Even if the average woman is meant to be interested in chads, there is no absolutely in no way shape or form a perfect correlation in this.

My theory is this: the majority of us are capable of attaining girlfriends. I know, immediately you’re racing to tell me to go away, but just wait. You don’t need plastic surgery, at least not most of you. You don’t really even need a lambo, just study and attain a stable, decently paying job, invest (crypto is at an excellent point right now) and have some money in the ready.

Let’s assume alwalt theory, wouldn’t the beta buxxer have a girlfriend first before getting married to some hoe who fucks guys behind his back?

Follow the golden pill, never get married, and the worst case scenario, you’ll have some extra money to spend on a vr porn headset in 10 years. Go to more meetups and introduce yourself, the more events you go to, the more likely you’ll meet a girl who’s interested in you, despite your looks.",1

Spend time with friends if you have them, if not take a walk enjoy nature take up a hobby (npc advice I know) but at the end of the day both you and Chad will be forgotten about in a few generations. All the loneliness you suffered all the intimacy chad experienced......think about it in a few decades both your experiences will mean nothing and even chad's descendants will forget about him.

Not trying to cope, but I don't think online dating stats really show much here. I say this because I've known a lot of black guys and I would have never guessed outside of the internet that black guys generally have problems attracting black women. And I've never, outside of the internet, heard black women even imply that they are not attracted to black men.

If there's a certain black man who is getting rejected by black women for the most part, it's highly likely that it's due to a flaw that does not include their race. I.E. they are ugly, short, non neuro-typical, broke or some combination thereof. Just like when a white woman rejects a particular white man, it's likely not because he's white, it's because he's ugly, short, non NT, broke or some combination thereof. And most black women who do end up with white men or another race of men have past sexual histories with black men.",1

1120,Braincels,"What do feminists do to ""challenge patriarchy"" ?

They whine about it.

It's not like they take arms and fight for their rights or anything.  What they do is look at men straight in the eyes and ask : ""why are you oppressing me ?""

Men think about it and say : ""yeah, why do I oppress her ?  Do I not value freedom ?  Shouldn't people be allowed to do whatever the fuck they want ?""

Feminism forced men to find a justification for patriarchy.  They couldn't, so they let women free.

This is the important point, one that YouTuber Turd Flinging Monkey often points out : women only have rights that men gave them.

But with their newly acquired freedom, what did women do ?  They showed their true nature, through the sexual revolution.  With it, they destroyed familial values, they turned men into pathetic simps, basically destroying civilization.

If men couldn't find a justification for patriarchy, I suspect they will find one soon enough.

It was naive to think that if men and women could both live completely free, everything would be alright.  Women are wild animals with a fantastic power over men due to the desire men have for them.   Giving women freedom is akin to what happens when you give a machine gun to a chimp.

Ever noticed that feminists, liberals sh*t on capitalism all the time? They adopt a mindset where everybody should get an equal piece of the pie and that rich people have no reason to be, because you don't need to live in a $2 million mansion and drive a lambo.

Which is fine, I guess, unless you also believe in a winner-takes-all mindset in the dating market at the same time.

Why am I saying that? Well, because women who enjoy fucking attractive men left and right are the rich people of the dating world.

But on the other side, they usually have little marketable skills, get useless degrees and end up working at Starbucks with a Gender Studies background.

1182,Braincels,"Western civilisation now has one huge problem: there are not enough taxpayers to fund the welfare system in the future. Due to females voting to steal money from men via the govt so they don't need husbands, and female hypergamy forcing men out of the breeding market, there will not be enough working men to keep the western economy going. The birthrate has stalled so that there will be no future workers to replace those retiring and enough men have already checked out to add further strain. Trying to replace these men with female workers worsens the birthrate problem.

Immigration has been the proposed solution to this, importing new male workers to keep this system going. However these immigrants are replacing the native population and inserting their forms of culture/civilisation. As more and more asians go to Australia, China is asserting more control there. As more hispanics go to America, southern US is looking more and more like Mexico. And more and more immigrants must flow in, indefinitely, or the system goes bust.

So either western civilisation as we know it collapses and restarts, or it is replaced with new peoples with their cultures. There's no other solution. The elites want to keep their wealth so they have gone with the immigration bandaid solution, and whilst that may keep them going for a while, it creates a very precarious future for their lineage. There are other possibilities, like technology, dictatorship, etc. but all of those things require a new system to replace the old, meaning western liberal democratic civilisation is over.

So basically the point I'm making is that the liberal democratic system that allows women to vote has already failed... I see a lot of people speculating about how it will collapse in the future, well that is undeniable reality today. The system has already reached a complete dead end and is finished. Women are just blithely partying and enjoying their greed as the ship goes down from 1960 to - , just as I'm sure they somewhat did in western Rome from 400 when their influence was already massively diminishing and the writing was on the wall to 476.

1201,Braincels,"I had a very similar route to probably a lot of you here. Discovered the red pill and NoFap towards the end of high school, had high hopes at the time, thought that i stumbled upon some secret knowledge that will let me become who i always wanted to be. Then it was mgtow, coping my way through life, still hoping somewhere in the back of my mind that things will change, that what everyone else was saying was true, that i was just a ""late bloomer"". After a while i couldn't cope anymore. Finally discovered the blackpill, and suddenly it all made so much sense. Everything i couldn't explain before, every instance when a girl was rude to me, mean to me, or when someone ignored me or simply didn't want me there despite my best efforts, made so much sense. Each negative life experience can be traced back to the blackpill. 

For a while, i felt relief. That faded with time. I was left with a lot of anger, and a lot of pain, which i couldn't cope away anymore. The things i used to enjoy are meaningless now. Every day, i leave a part of myself behind, and with each day, i feel lesser. Like there's a permanent hole in my soul that simply keeps getting bigger and bigger. At this point i think one day i'll wake up and there will be nothing left, that hole will eat away at me until i just cease to exist. The saddest thing is, i welcome it. Not existing seems like a far, far better alternative than this.

The worst thing about it, you can never escape. You can try, that's for sure. Maybe you can even forget about the blackpill for a while. I tried to get away from it a couple of times. At first it kinda seems like you can do it, but inevitably it starts clawing it's way back into your brain. Once you know the truth, no amount of lies can make you forget it. Knowing the truth doesn't make it any less unbearable, and that's all you can believe at this point. It's like being freed from a lying, immoral society, and being left to fend for yourself in an even colder and more cruel reality. Turns out, freedom is an inescapable hellhole, and you can never be free from it, ironically.",1

I'd take him to the gym and start a normal lifting routine, focused on having fun with moving the body and building up a habit from there. This should increase his sense of security and confidence in himself, which is a powerful foundation in life. Then, assuming he is over 15, I'd grow magic mushrooms with him and take it with him, embarking on an ego melting spiritual journal together to show him that the mind is infinitely flexible, and that he has the power to shape his own mind. If that doesn't work, I'd take him to a couple of ayahuasca trips to kindle his interest in the spiritual side of life. With a strong physical and spiritual foundation, I believe he will be better positioned to tackle other challenges in life. If it doesn't work, it'll be a hell of a bonding experience.

yet 0 of them have wanted to offer an incel sex

a few may have posted searching for a fake chad-incel. but none have posted saying ""looks dont matter to me. who wants to bang""

if there are any women out there that actually want to prove this statement wrong. feel free to post a thread offering incels (nearby you) sex. it wont get banned. lets see if there is a single female out there down to break the norm.

(requirement are female must be under age 25, or must be pretty cute if over age 25)

femcels might say ""but omg. your saying you only want hot women to offer you sex. omg stacy chaser!!""

and my answer is this. if you have sex with an ugly person, then it doesnt count as sex

an incel could ""have sex"" with a disgusting 55 year old grandmother. that doesnt mean its real sex. 

sex ONLY ""counts"" (for you. for both men and women) if your doing it with a sexually attractive person

if a girl has sex with a ugly guy (like prostitution) in her mind the sex wont even ""count"" as sex

if a chad has sex with a ugly girl (which they do alot), in his mind the sex wont even ""count"" as sex . but for the ugly girl, in her mind, the sex ""counted"" as sex

so basically. if a ugly person and a hot person have sex, then the sex ""counts"" for the ugly person but it ""doesnt count"" for the hot person

anyway. all im trying to say here is

there are TONS, and TONS, and TONS of ""hot men"" that would be willing to offer sex to a forum filled with ugly women (femcels)

however. it is incredible. there is NOT ONE SINGLE MOTHERFUCKING ""hot girl"" that is willing to offer sex to a forum filled with ugly men

thats just incredible when you think of those odds

you would expect, over time, maybe ONE fucking attractive female would have posted here offering some poontang. but nope. nothing",1

1267,Braincels,"I come to you, in hopes of progress and advancement. With no disrespect to anyone, I myself am not an incel, I have had relationships with women ever since I could notice attraction to them. That being said, I want to let you know that whatever people say, (most of the things, the down to earth stuff, not the hate, kill and etc) you are not wrong about so many things when it comes to women and social structure aspects. In all honesty im conflicted by the fact that you are loners, but yet, hold beliefs that I feel are all true and accurate, most of the things (that I have read) you talk about (even though the groupthink assholes and beta bitchmales put it on your poor experience with feemales) are just fact, no matter the cost (people will use this post to attack my non mainstream opinions) I want you to know (in my opinion as a non indoctrinated free thinker) you are neither delusional, nor wrong. The smarter women are also mysoginists. They see the true situation of their sex's way of being. Im posting this to try and make some of you understand that violence is not the way to go. Use the internet and its anon advantages into ridiculing the current structure and ""movements"" of these so called feminists. Create fake profiles (im sure these tactics are currently being used against you too), chadfish stupid women into sending you money cause ""you're going through a hard time"" or have them go long distances to end up dissapointed, post incredibly (but credible) idiotic messages on the behalf of them. Just take actions that show the true state of affairs of these leashed up and dominated cucks. I have little respect for groupthink fucks (reddit is full of them). Research OPSec and anon methods, use the time that you gain by not bothering with the opposite sex constructively (even if in the end it might not change anything, although I assure you it might), violence will only hurt your situation, it will make these so called ""good people"", ""progressives"" and virtue signallers to bully you more. Not to mention the fact that govt will jump on this train since stokimg fear within the general population is the name of the game for current governments everywhere. Spread the word, renounce violence, use the weapons and tactics of social engineering against the status quo as it is being used against you. Women, gays and trans are part of the plan to dominate and subjugate the males of the western world, its not conspiracy, its social manipulation to take the balls away from men and our generation is the first one to be have this tactic / weapon used against it. We may lack the cohesion to win this battle, but we must damn well fight it to the end even if we will lose. Victory to the enemy must not be given freely. I hope this message will reach enough of you to change something for the better. Name of the game is and will always be covert action and manipulation, not violence. Remember that.",1

As I drove away I became very infuriated. It was such an insult. This was the way all girls treated me, and I was sick and tired of it. In a rage, I made a U-turn, pulled up to their bus stop and splashed my Starbucks latte all over them. I felt a feeling a spiteful satisfaction as I saw it stain their jeans. I then quickly speeded away before they could catch my license plate number. How dare those girls snub me in such a fashion! How dare they insult me so! I raged to myself repeatedly. They deserved the punishment I gave them. It was such a pity that my latte wasn’t hot enough to burn them.

1285,shortcels,"Frist of all, I'm not a redpilled player or a MGTOW selling you the idea of ""go your own way brah, let's find ourselves"" no, I'm aware us incels are repulsive to women and we are SENT our own way, not chose to go our own way like some alpha fucker, that's a delusion MGTOWs and part of the redpilled community often fall into, again, we are men SENT our own way, because our genes aren't worthy of being passed on and women hate us and see us as subhumans, 

With that out of the way I firmly believe that you can still be happy, 

Let me tell you when I first took the blackpill, I got depressed as FUCK, I lost my motivation to work out, got angry and bitter that my bloodline ends with me, realized I wouldn't have grandkids or would never introduce my nice pretty ""girl next door"" to my parents, I would never cuddle to sleep with her, would never go on a honeymoon or on a romantic trip to Europe, would never have anyone to dedicate love songs to, etc

I fell into a deep hole of depression and vices, vidya all day, cooming to more and more degenerate porn, booze and cigarettes, sleeping 14 hrs or more, not showering and became a fucking mess

Eventually the blackpill settled in my mind, and it was just a part of life, it didn't hurt anymore, it was just as natural as the sunset

""Women are degenerate animals who only chose based on appearance "" 

This wasn't a shocking fact or novelty thing I learned, it was just a part of life, something that simply is, and nothing can change it

And then I realized it didn't have to affect my happiness, think about this

Are you depressed because you dont have a private jet? Are you depressed because you don't have a mansion in Dubai and own a yatch? Probably not, you simply realize that's a luxury destined to a small portion of the population, and we happen to not be there, it's not something that affects you or ruins your happiness 

Relationships are for me like a private jet or like a luxury mansion or like 10 Gold Ferraris, something simply not meant for me to have and I'm slowly being okay with that

Now, I'm not an IT fucker sayings you should turn your emotions off or a MGTOW telling you to embark on your epic journey to self discovery

But I mean this, build your own happiness 

I've gotten into powerlifting recently, I'm one of the strongest guys in the gym, and they all respect me, hell even tall chads respect my manlet strength 

SAVE MONEY, think about it like this, if so many men and betabuxx can never save big amounts of money because they have to provide for ""muh kween"" and ~~Tyrone's children~~ their kids, we don't, we're not getting married or have to provide for a family, we're making money for ONE and can spend it like ONE, save money, get good copes, save for a nice apartment, move from your country if you live in a third world shithole, after all, you don't have a family you need to spend your money on

and all of those who say lookism if gonna affect your chances and that you're not gonna get a good job are full of fucking cope! Yeah lookism might help/prevent us giving a good first impression in a job interview, but hear me out, ABILITIES are what let people stay with their jobs and make good money

Ever realized how many curries and ricecels work in tech support and IT? I'm telling you, they didn't get the job because of their good looks, their abilities helped them get and keep the job, at least in the laboral world, efficiency and abilities are more valuable than looks, in the long run at least

BE A VALUABLE ASSET, I couldn't care less if an employee of mine was a 5""1"" balding curry, if he was efficient as fuck and did everything right, and most people in the laboral job wont either if you are valuable 

Atm I got out of my funk, am a competitive powerlifter, have saved more money than ever, and found some cozy copes in movies, music production, coffee tasting and fabricating, traveling, and skating

i stopped drinking, stopped fapping, stopped being a lazy fuck and am actually decently happy now, and a relationship is just as unachievable to me as having 10 ferraris, and I'm okay with that

GET A GOOD GROUP OF FRIENDS

whoever says men will treat you like shit bc of lookism or that it is impossible to make friends as an incel is COPING again

Yeah, maybe you wont get to lead a football team, or be bros with a bunch of male models, but men don't care about attractiveness, specially when it comes to their bros, as much as women

Search for a good group of friends,

I have a stable group of brocels and we play vidya together, get drunk at times, go camping, go travel to the beach and they are all ugly as fuck just as me, but we're coping together and being truecel bros together 

For those of you who are social retards or introverts, I'm gonna give you an IT-ish tip, work on your social skills, 

Now before you shoot me

I'm not saying that if you work on your social skills, you can trick a woman into falling in love with you, I'm not a dumbfuck like IT, that doesn't happen, but if you can be just a little non retarded and non weird, when talking to men that might be potential bros, you can get a squad of friends 

Look for friends in places and hobbies of yours, I got some of my bros from shitty live music events in my city and some skateboarding parks, similar hobbies unite similar people, and men won't reject you or deny their friendship because you're ugly, at least not like-minded individuals

You can be happy, it may take some time and some of you may not swallow the blackpill as easily as me, but if you do and start building your happiness outside of relationships, you can be happy, I don't want to give roasties that much power over Me

I would never rope, there are just too many good copes and things I want to do before I die

I want to learn piano, I want to go to the Arizona canyon, I want to meet my favorite band, I want to travel to Australia, I want to watch a lot of Classic cinema

And none of it has to do with relationships of having a woman

Again, I'm not ""going my own way"" like an alpha, I was sent my own way, but I intend to be happy here",1

One, the mean a 6/10 instead of a 9/10, when they say ugly. Or a 5'10"" guy instead of a 6'4"" when they mean go for short guys. 

Two, the reasons they cite are ""ugly men are less abusive and don't cheat as much."" However, women ACTUALLY LIKE attractive men that are abusive cheaters. Those are POSITIVE QUALITIES for men, according to women. They are TURNED ON by that. So, an ugly guy who's loyal will always be worse than an attractive guy who cheats and beats up his girl.",1
1295,shortcels,"The period between 2000 BC and 1975 was the golden age of humanity. Praising virgin marriage, slut shaming, stoning to death if found guilty of adultery, fearing hell, no birth control. And all this was done to keep female hypergamy in check. 

During the stone age or the ice age women were hypergamous as fuck. And all the successful civilizations knew this, so they implemented patriarchy to prevent it. Had it not been for patriarchy, the world would've been like Mad Max type dystopia. Hardworking and successful men, men with high IQ fucked plenty of holes and passed on their genes. Patriarchy prevented their genes from phasing out of the genepool. 

But now there is no patriarchy to prevent female hypergamy. Women have been given full sexual freedom and they'll only choose those men who can make their holes tingle. The only superior genes which is going to prevail is ""good looks"" and ""great height"" and nothing else. Societal progession has run its course, its all going downhill from here and I'm glad I won't be a part of that future.",1

1301,shortcels," u don't get it, do you? Have you ever tried to see beyond the superior/inferior-analogy that we are slaves to? With that kind of logic, killing ugly people for the sake of ""bettering"" the gene-pool would seem like an awesome and humane idea, except for the fact that genetic recombination is a thing. You could have an island full of beautiful people, and think that their society would become an utopia, but sure enough, the same 80/20-rule would slowly begin to show itself again. Beauty is what makes the world spin, because one of the major side-effects of beauty is resentment, and if you don't know this already, resentment is what truly drives us. When we look at beautiful people, we become resentful, and we're forced to become cunning, and develop other ways to survive and get partners, since we can't get resources and mates as easily as beautiful people. And the most beautiful people often end up blind to the fortune that they inherited, since they get so used to it. And as we all know, there are different levels of beauty. Everything is relative to each individuals genetics and environment that they were brought up in, that decides what sort of financial/sexual life that they are going to live. These are very complicated mechanisms, but just because they are complicated, doesn't mean they aren't predictable. We are slaves to these mechanisms, and beauty is one of many causes which influence our decisions in life. This is all clockwork. The whole superior/inferior analogy is just a way for our brains to measure what the best possible action is for us to take. Like I've said in many many many of my comments, we are machines. Beauty is just a measurement, just like pleasure and pain. We avoid the ugly, like we avoid pain, just like we avoid the dark. It's all a survival-mechanism that never gets satisfied, these mechanisms never reach a point. And in my series, I will explain why. And it will all finally make sense.**Show less**",1

1304,shortcels,"Hello r/shortcels , I have found your sub randomly and was really fascinated by all of these posts. Yes some of them depicts clearly the average female, however I do think height isn’t that big of a issue. Yes being short will limit you to shorter women but it won’t limit your ability to find your soulmate... To explicit my point, I am short (5’5), and I found the love of my life (5’2 maybe?) as there were no signs of anything going better for me. She just spawned into my life, I turned my life around for her I wasn’t really into legal things, I was suicidal, my only bother was my sport and now everything has changed. I’m the happiest man alive and I know that with 8 billion people in the world there are some out there in the same situation as me! Keep hope, work on yourself, everything will happen in time...

1330,shortcels,"What does femcels mean ? A short version of ""female Incel"", right ?

The ""female"" part explains itself 

Now what does Incel mean ? ""involuntary celibates"", a person which wants to have sex but can't have sex.
Both criteria needs to be fullfilled. For example a A-sexual person can't be an Incel even if he doesn't have sex because of the fact he doesn't WANT to have sex in the first place. 

(You don't have to hate women or regonize that people care more about look than personality to be an Incel)

Most femcels admited that they get offered sex by men but it doesn't count because they're ""pigmens"" or ""moids"". 

It's fact that they declined a sex offer even if they don't like the person. This makes them a ""Voluntarily Celibate"" (Volcel)  They don't have the right to say ""nobody wants me"" instead they need to say ""The people I want don't want me""",1

And the ones that this will hurt the most is not us, but the ones in charge. So do you think the coronovirus is a man made thing created by officials to stop this women hypergamy problem? 

Because I’m thinking after all of this social isolation is over perhaps women is going to start to be able to sympathize with lonely men because they felt just a fraction of what they feel and it will stop their hypergamy ways and they will start to go for all types of men and stop sleeping around so much.

I guess nothing I could say could get you out of the deep hole many of yall are in, so Im not even going to try.

If this foid is intelligent in any way she WILL use her newfound knowledge of her own inherent sexual worth to manipulate and harm men as it is within her own selfish imperative to get the best she can. It's a deeply unsettling idea for men to understand, but it's fair.

Males and females in every species (at least when there are two fixed sexes) have been, are and forever will be at war until the end of life in the universe. I do hope for some form of tenuous equality but I guess if this cannot be achieved then I'd rather males [redacted] females than vice-versa because I have to fight for myself and my own gender.

I posted here last week that I was gonna rope.
Things were so bad, and I was actually gonna do it.
But I’m gonna explain why I didn’t do it and basically everything, so this post could be long.

Fear of death, and the unknown have stopped me.
I decided to keep looking for an apartment for a few more days before I actually do it, just as a last try( one of the main reasons that made me wanna do it, is because I didn’t want to end up being homeless and live on the streets)

Anyways, I left my stuff in my flatmate‘s room.
And only took my backpack with me. ( with my laptop, chargers, wallet, cigarettes and a bottle of vodka)

It was time to experience what it’s like to be homeless. 
Spent most of my time at fast food places. And at night I’d go to the train station and sleep for a couple of hours on a bench. 

I’d go once a day to shower and shave at my old apartment. ( She didn’t know I was homeless, as my pride would never let me admit such thing, I told her that I’m staying with a friend but his shower is broke and clogged)

Anyways, 2 days ago, I got a response from a girl who I messaged 2 weeks beforehand about her room.
She asked if I could come over the next day to see it and talk details.
And of course my answer was yes.

Fast forward to the next day. I go there, I text her that I’ve arrived. 
She comes outside to meet me.
Then we go to the apartment, I took a look at the apartment and the room. It was fine, nothing special.
And then she told me that she’s packing her stuff and that she’s gonna move out in a few hours.

So if I’m interested I should let her know.
Again my answer was yes.
She gave me the keys and told me, just give me a couple of more hours until I’m done with packing my stuff.

And I moved in there in a matter of hours.
I didn’t even pay her the deposit, she told me that she trusts me to transfer the money to her later.

Most people are not staying boyfriend and girlfriend for 40+ years, they either marry or they break up, and since most marriages end in a divorce, we can conclude from all of this that most relationships end in a break up.

1413,shortcels,"hi reddit.

so just a few days ago my wife's new boyfriend, Lebarion was found guilty of armed robbery as well as grand theft auto, and was sentenced to three years in prison. the reason why this happened was because of the fact that I was fired and replaced at my old coffee shop job by a female of color (wonderful girl, really has a way with words) who reportedly reads at a 4th grade level, and got fired from eight previous positions for physical fighting.

anyway after I explained to my wife that I had been fired for not giving a person of color a free set of refreshments, she had gotten to the point where she was yelling at me and insulting me as she usually does when she's angry (in which I understood. she had been going through a lot because of her previous boyfriend's arrest for shooting at my house) and she had stormed out of my house, and departed to one of her friends houses. she didn't come back to my house until the next day, when she happened to call my cell while at one of her childhood friend's houses. she broke the news to me that her boyfriend, Lebarion, had been arrested following the robbery I had actually heard he planned at a corner store in the bad part of our city.

the day that I got fired from my job, was when the robbery happened. the day before, was when Lebarion directly asked me to drive him to said corner store so he could 'handle some business'. My wife had told me if I accepted she'd bake a Smash Bros themed cake for my birthday. I had to refuse, mainly because of the chance that I'd take of getting arrested because of my involvement of the robbery. Lebarion began to insult me in unison with my wife, and it ultimately led to Lebarion grabbing at my phone, and making a phone call to a friend of his, saying he'd need a ride on the next day to the mentioned corner store.

I knew that this friend wasn't in the position to drive safely, and I effectively had to drive Lebarion to safety from the police without incident, and I was right. immediately after the robbery, a chase ensued and it ultimately ended in a near fatal crash.

as a white male with an elevated socio-economic status as opposed to an african american, my wife entailed I could have successfully driven him away from the scene without incident in my Prius due to my influence upon white, all-american cops as a fellow white male, which is the makeup of most of our police department.

my wife was sobbing heavily over the phone, telling me that I was a huge loser and she would never come back to live with me. Though, again, she was simply angry over the circumstances. later on, she came back to my house after I told her that I obtained another job, and obtained a small complementary, under the table paycheck on my first day.

even now that she's back to sleeping on the couch in my living room, which isn't normal from her sleeping on her separate bed in our bedroom. I really didn't mean to hurt her, but what else could I have done? If I just happened to NOT have luck while pulling off a getaway, I would have easily been spending time behind bars at the time that I'm writing this post.",1

I’ll tell you my life story summed up so far and maybe the incel community and non-incel community can get some sort of mutual understanding. Or you know, call me an asshole and chad or whatever. Anyway here goes.

I was born in Denmark 17 years ago. I was the typical child wonder in terms of maths, reading and learning English. I got bullied every day from when I was 6 years old to 14. I had 1 good friend and a couple of other friends. I had a girlfriend in 5th grade...for a couple of days. In 7th,8th and 9th grade I got some really good friends and I went to parties and such. At these parties, I tried my luck but never had any success. 
I have, and still do play a lot of video games, im not and wasn't very athletic, and i didn't really have anything i was really good at other than school and video games. i started playing piano but i wasn't very good.

So far I'm guessing most of you can relate. 
After 9th grade when I was 15 I signed up for something called afterschool. I was gonna live on an island for the next year or so, with 150 other kids like me. This is a pretty big island with like 3000-4000 people on it, and it's in Denmark so don't think of it as an island in the Bahamas with palm trees and such.
This is where my life truly changed i belive. Normally on schools like this you stay there for a week, and go home in the weekends, but since this was on an island you only really went home every 3-4 weeks. I had the normal classes, English, Maths, Chemistry and so on but i also had to chose 6 or more special classes that i then would spend most of my time on. I chose Hunting, Musisc classes, Scuba diving, Pilots license, Sea kayaking, Advanced english and falcon hunting.

yeah i know right, but this is just to set the tone of the school, we had to choose 6 or a few more out of 36 choices like this.
On the first week of this school i got my first girlfriend. I had my hunting license already, and one the girls in my class found it hot that i was good at shooting. over at few days we went from acquaintances to a couple. I lived for most of the school in a small house with 5 other guys who became my best friends. Almost everybody lived in small rooms in buildings but we lived in a small house of our own, which really helped us get the pus pus in the long run.

I just realized how long this is so ill wrap it up.

The year went by, all in all i was in 3 relationships, all of them sexual since the age of consent is 16 in denmark. When i was home and invited to parties, and i got really good at playing piano. I learned a bunch of things and got kinda popular-ish. Me and my roomies played DnD which started small with only about 3 people but it evolved to a point where we at the standard session had 8 players, 2 Dm's and people who would come in and watch and laugh with us.

After the school ended and I broke up with my then girlfriend, met up with a female friend of mine who later became my long-distance girlfriend now of 7 months.
The school started on august 12th 2018 and ended 29 of june 2019. Right now i go to school in copenhagen where i've achived my childhood dream of actually having friends,getting hit on by girls at parties and having something im really good at (piano).

This was really long which i didn't mean to but there you go, the life of a 185cm (a bit more than 6 feet), good looking ( in my own humble opinion) danish boy. Now tell me your stories",1
1439,shortcels,"I don't want to go in to specific details about people in my personal life but any situation where I need to interact with females for school, work etc is torture. Maintaining literally any kind of interpersonal relationship with a woman stresses me the fuck out. Even when I don't express any kind of romantic interest in them and just try to be a pleasant acquaintance for academic/work purposes they find a way to make it complicated and stressful, usually by weirdly and constantly flip-flopping between being generally amicable to being really rude and passive aggressive for no apparent reason.

1449,shortcels,"Why don't you guys support each other (ACTUALLY support each other) here instead of keeping each other miserable?

Look. All of you are in desperate need of mental health help and you all for the most part seem pretty self aware of that. you also seem to understand that wallowing in the fact that the world is cruel and superficial will do nothing. but let me just repeat that real quick. WALLOWING IN THE FACT THAT THE WORLD IS CRUEL AND SUPERFICIAL WILL DO  N O T H I N G. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Every second you spend feeling sorry for yourself is wasted. Im a hypocrite for saying this. I spend a disgusting amount of my time feeling sorry for myself. But i want to change, i dont want to feel sorry for myself ever again, because this is no way to spend a life, it's so repetitive, sad and empty. You need to understand, that you CAN do better, you CAN improve yourself and your life. Happiness is possible, but sometimes it's difficult. Sometimes you have to live a ""lie"" to be happy. And that's okay. There's nothing wrong with the blue pill. Life is literally what you make of it. The amount of effort and time you spend in improving yourself is what you get out of it. And I don't mean superficial improvement, I mean mindset improvement. Some of you are racist, most of you guys are incredibly sexist, and all of you are in major denial of some real facts of life. You deny that the situation youre in has anything to do with your personality and outlook on life. And that's just not true. I'm not saying you don't struggle, im sure all of you have a story for how you ended up with this mindset, perhaps you were bullied, or abused, or struggled with mental health issues that led you down this rabbit hole. Most of you probably have autism, and im not saying that to be cruel, im saying that because i can see how that would make many more obstacles in your life. 

I feel sorry for all of you, but at the same time some of you are just straight up horrible. I dont know why, but racism is REALLY rampant in the incel community, so it's pretty obvious why people are telling you why your personality is the reason you cant get a girlfriend. but besides that, there's a few other obvious things people are referring to when they talk about an unattractive personality: depression, lack of perspective, and covert narcissism. And all of those are probably tied together for some of you. People don't like to be around someone who is a downer, because many people are worn out themselves, so if they ever have the choice they're going to surround themselves with happy people. It's unfortunate, but it's true. You have to be happy with yourself before trying to find another to make you happy. And if you put a ton of effort into being happy and still cant find another person, well, at least now you are happier with yourself.

 I highly suggest that you get a dog (ONLY IF YOURE ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT) because they are very loving and kind creatures, and a definite helpful remedy to depression. 

Lookism is real, there's no denying that. But the world is unforgiving and cruel, and it's YOUR choice as to whether or not that makes you miserable. I believe that-for at least most people-rewiring your brain to be less superficial is completely possible. So why not live a blue pill lie if you have a choice. The black pill is also a lie. It's projection of your own beliefs. You CHOSE to live your life thinking that you will always be miserable. You chose to focus on the things in your life that you cannot control. Don't do this to yourself. If you truly believe that you are ugly enough that nothing, ever, not surgery, not an amazing personality, will ever get you a girlfriend, dont worry about it. I know it's not that simple, but it can be done. Dont let your mind think about it. Ever. Just dont. What's the point fantasizing? Either work towards improvement, with motivation and hope, or, if improvement in one part of your life is impossible, use your time to find joys in other parts of life. Art, music, writing, reading, just learning in general helps you feel like at the end of the day you have done something that makes you a better person. Or you could hang out on this toxic sub. It's up to you. 

So get off reddit right now and do something, ANYTHING, that can make your life better. And when you fail, try again and fail better next time. I'm going to be real with you, I feel sorry for a lot of you because i also feel sorry for myself. Honestly i think part of the reason i spent so much time writing this post was also to motivate myself. What's the worst that's gonna happen? Maybe you'll still be alone, but at least you're going to feel better about yourself for trying your best. Log off reddit right now (im doing the same) and dont allow yourself to fall deeper into this horribly toxic mindset, spend every second of your time being happy through some sort of improvement (mentally more importantly than superficially) and always, always, always keep yourself busy with it. There's nothing wrong with the blue pill.",1

1455,shortcels,"So, over the weekend I did a Chadletfish on bumble using this (Chad)[https://www.instagram.com/hagenrichter/]. This Chad is what I would consider a weak 8 facially but a strong 8 overall considering that he is likely around 6 foot rather than 5'6. But, for the purposes of the experiment, I made him 5'6. The results were terrible. He got about 20 likes within the first day and then it dwindled off to less than 5 a day. Today I deleted the account. I only managed to actually match with 5 of the women. Only 2 messaged him. They were low quality women, one was an average black girl with a nice body, the other was a 4/10 white woman who was worthless. Both unmatched when I attempted to make the conversation sexual. They were enthusiastic until I moved things to hookup territory. 

I was quite hopeful coming into this when I saw the likes coming in, but in the end 5'6 seems to be over unless you're a solid 8+. He could have likely gotten a girlfriend easily, but she would be much below his looks level and it would be like a 6' normies relationship. Another poster was successful with a 5'8 Tyrone, so 5'8 seems like the cutoff before women see you as low quality regardless of your face.

1458,shortcels,"Tl;Dr: Short men are less physically and sexually imposing, so women like making friends with short men. People see a short dude with his girl friends and just assume that he's fucking all of them when that's not even close to happening.

Growing up, I always had more girl friends than guy friends (thanks mostly to the fact that I have two sisters, so I was around girls all the time). I still socialize easily with women. Many of them are decently attractive. Between 16 and 21, I always had some guy friends ask me how I get so many girls. They assume that because I hanged out with girls and talked with them easily that I must be fucking all of them. That is far from the truth, but these same guys would later on and go say stuff like, ""So I know this 5'5"" guy who talks with so many girls it's insane!""

Women love befriending short dudes for these reasons.

Short men are less physically and sexually imposing. When most women look at a short man, they don't really see a man. Short men tend to have exhibit neoteny; In humans, this happens when a human's legs are proportionally shorter and head is proportionally larger. This makes women more attractive to men, but for women it illicits a response similar to a mother and her child, or a pet owner and their kitten. Women feel extremely comfortable around short men and might even adore them as they would a child, but there's no sexual tension involved. And because short men are physically smaller, women don't instinctively feel threatened by them as they would with a more normal-sized man.

Short men tend to compensate for their lack of physical presence with personality and charisma. A lot of women like this because it's easier to talk to someone who knows how to talk with others. Since women are very social, they really like this and want to be friends with sociable people.

Short men give more attention and time to a woman than other men do. Most short guys subconsciously know that women don't find them sexually attractive, so they try to make up for it by showering girls with attention and favours AKA being an orbiter. Women love this because they can get the validation they need from a guy who sort of looks like a man without having to give him anything in return.

Combine these traits together and women find short men to be the perfect friend; A male who is not a physical threat, who can talk normally and make them feel special. Don't be fooled though, he's not fucking any of them, nor will his girl friends wingwoman him. Also, he'll only continue being friends with them as long as he showers them with attention and listens to their problems. Once he stops doing that, the friendship quickly ends. Once he starts getting sexual or making an advance on a girl, he'll be seen as a creep/nice guy whatever you name it.

However, the average man, who is typically never friends with women sees this short guy walking with a bunch of girls and thinks, ""Man, this guy is a womanizer!"" He doesn't know any better, but he will tell his friends about this womanizer short guy, then the word will spread and spread until a normie comes on Reddit and says, ""I know a 4'10"" guy who gets lots of chicks!""

Also, the short guy will likely lie and say that he's hooked up with some of them to save face and not appear like an orbiter, making this myth even more apparent.

Trust me, if personality and being friends with women were all that is needed to get women, I'd be drowning in pussy right now. However, I'm still a kissless virgin. Nobody in my social life knows this because they just assume that I'm a womanizer.",1

The burden of existence exhausts me and brings me to my knees. Making me beg for the suffering to end, screaming for just a single moment of quietness inside my troubled mind.

The void inside me fills my days with an aching desire for something I cannot have. Human contact is what I crave most, the feeling of intimacy with another human being who trusts and fancies me enough to allow me touch them. This, however, stays only on my mind.

I am going to drown. The darkness below awaits me when I finally let go. Not longer clinging to this broken ship called Life.

A lifelong battle coming to an end. I'm not strong enough. I feel guilty for having such thoughts, as if I am betraying my family.. those who really care about me. I wish my weakness didn't scream louder than my will to go on.

The salty water makes me sick. My body craves something clean, but I cannot have it. I cannot reach it.

There's beauty in life. Just not in mine. I see others rejoice while I weep, alone in darkness. It's over.

Overdue is my death. Yet I'm scared of the nothingness. Everything scares me.

Too weak to face life. Too weak to end it.

The lack of meaning haunts me, fills my mind with uncertainty, doubt and hate. Darkness all around.

Why should I keep going when my presence goes unnoticed?

It is so easy to lose control to feel euphoric even if just for such a short period of time

I know I am not special in any way. As I write this, other humans suffer on this sick planet we live on

My lack of talent makes me ashamed. The useless nature of my being keeps me up at night

Not worthy of love, not worthy of sharing joyful moments with others. I am disgusting

Life is too difficult. We don't make it difficult, it's the nature of life itself. The mentally weak cannot deal

I wonder how people will react when they find my body after I make the suffering end.

​

Everything is bleak. Life's true nature shows itself to me as I cry in despair. Life is lonesome, Life is ugly.

A sentiment consumes me, one of despair and sadness. Pushing me towards the edge, the inevitable point of no return.

The flame is dead. Holding on to warm ashes is of no use. Letting go is needed when the joy is dead.

Pathetic. Everything about the words I write is pathetic. My attempt at pretending to be good,at anything, is pathetic. Nothing makes sense.

I can not stop. It hurts but it is what it is. Death is supposed to be painful. I deserve the pain. I am too weak for life. In the end, It's all for the best.

You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.

Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.

As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically",1

Like the kind that makes you dance in front of a device in order to make someone go “that’s cool” and tap the screen? It does nothing for either party. No social validation, the person who liked just forgets about you and moves on to the next video, and no currency or valued reward for the creator. So what is the reason to make or consume? Especially in our world? It’s like people have no value for human life or the earth, which is good but they don’t do it in a good way. Instead of giving up they think they are in control and try to make fun of the current situation to make them and others feel better, and again, in control.

From then on, it becomes a vicious cycle of self hatred and low confidence. It is very hard to leave this mental state.

Well, here is the problem. ITers, you're not a ''support group'' if you try to ban incel subs as well as find very poor justifications behind mocking them. You're bullies.
