___________

The world began to spin again as they tumbled to the ground, but he wasn’t looking this time. He shut his eyes tight and buried his head in her chest, the bony ribs of her armor digging into his cheek. He could still feel them spinning though, and they rolled over and over before they finally made it to the floor. His head was still spinning and he felt a bit disoriented, but at least he was on the ground. He let out an audible sigh of relief.
“You can open your eyes now, Soren.” Rubedo purred.
He opened his eyes, only to find that he was somehow hanging inches from the floor. Startled, he jumped and gave a small shout. She responded with a barking laugh, pulling him upwards and spinning him around. “Gotcha!” She chirped. “Oh Soren, your face was priceless!”
He heard a voice from his right. It came from another clown, this one in an ethereal mirrored mask. He couldn’t tell what they were saying, but they seemed annoyed. Rubedo replied nonchalantly, and casually put him down to speak with the newcomer. Soren stood beside her awkwardly, glancing at the assembled clowns. All of them were staring at him. He felt like he was in the middle of a nightmare. He looked down to make sure he still had pants on. He did. At least one thing wasn’t going wrong today.
The mirror-masked clown spoke up, seemingly addressing the crowd, and the clown in the flower-painted mask appeared, walking into the circle. The three began to have a conversation. The flower-painted clown seemed rather emotional, and he felt bad for her. He hoped she hadn’t gotten into too much trouble on his behalf. After a few moments of arguing he didn’t understand, two new clowns stepped into the circle.
The first one seemed to be important, because everyone turned to look at them when they spoke. The second was the one that had been fighting the giant daemon earlier. Up close, they seemed somewhat… unsettling. They had a hood pulled over their mask. He couldn’t see it in detail, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to. As the mirror-masked clown and the flower-masked clown spoke with the important-looking clown, Soren leaned close to Rubedo.
“What the fuck is going on,” he whispered
“Odile wants to take you with us.” Rubedo whispered back
“Which one is Odile?” He replied, looking between the three of them.
“The one who saved you!” she hissed. He got the sense that, beneath her expressionless mask, she was looking at him as if he were stupid. “Orpheus, the Esdainn, wants to leave you here, and Cyra, the Athair, is mediating.”
“I… don’t know what those titles mean.” Soren whispered
“I’ll explain later.” Rubedo replied, gently patting him on the shoulder. With that she withdrew, and both returned their attention to the discussion at hand. 
Soren noticed that the hooded clown was gone. He had forgotten to ask Rubedo who that was. They were probably important, because they had been following the one that was probably Cyra around, and they seemed to be important. Cyra was mediating this whole thing, so they were probably, like, the leader or something. Or a commissar. Do they have commissars? He turned to look at the crowd around them, only to see that the hooded clown was now standing next to him, staring at him. He hadn’t noticed them approach, and that frightened him far more than the initial shock of realizing they were there. They seemed to have a daemonic mask under their hood, and it was molded into an inquisitive expression. He tapped Rubedo’s arm. She ignored him. The clown came closer and knelt down, still staring at him. He tapped Rubedo’s arm again, more insistently this time, and she turned
“What is it you-” She broke off into what was most likely a curse and roughly dragged him away from the hooded clown. They didn’t react, just tracked them with their eyes.
“What’s the deal?” He whispered “Who is that?”
“That’s the Arebennian,” Rubedo whispered “She’s… pretend she isn’t there, okay?”
“What does she want?” He asked nervously.
“No idea.” She replied. “Don’t worry about it.” With that, she guided him in front of her, resting her arms over his shoulders.
He stood there quietly for a few more minutes as things progressed around him, occasionally glancing at the aliens around them. The Arebennian seemed to be keeping her distance, but she was still staring at him. It unsettled him, and he tried to avoid looking at her as much as possible. Rubedo had told him not to worry about it, but her frightened reaction to the Arebennian’s approach said otherwise. He was shaken from his thoughts by the fact that things seemed to be wrapping up. There was a lot of nodding and the clowns were starting to mill about.
“Hey.” said Rubedo, picking him up. “It’s decided. You’re coming with us.”
She handed him off to Odile while saying something that sounded congratulatory before floating back up to the ceiling again. He looked up at Odile, and she looked down at him. He wasn’t entirely sure what to say. A thank you seemed in order, but… a part of him balked at having to thank an alien.
“Are you alright?” she asked, her mask shifting to an expression of gentle concern. “Rubedo didn’t hurt you, did she?”
“I’m fine.” He said “She was a little rough with me when pulling me away from the Arebeny- the Arebenen-” The alien word felt weird in his mouth, and he couldn’t quite get it to sound the way Rubedo had.
“I believe mon’keigh call them Solitaires.” Odile replied “If you’re having too much trouble with the Aeldari word.”
“Thank you.” He said.
“You’re very welcome, Soren.” She replied sweetly.
“Um. For everything.” He continued, the words spilling from his mouth. “Really, I didn’t think- Well- Um- You had no reason to help me. So- Um- Now you’re helping me more, and- I- Well- I just hope you’re not in any trouble on my behalf.”
“Orpheus spoils her, so he’ll forgive her in no time,” Rubedo interrupted, appearing suddenly from the left. “She’ll be just fine.”
Odile said something, probably a rebuttal of some sort, and Rubedo laughed. As the two bickered in their own language, the mirror-masked clown walked up to them. They said something stern, likely an admonishment. Rubedo replied with something playful before departing, leaving only the three of them. They said something to Odile before turning to him.
“You are a guest of the troupe,” they said coldly, “behave accordingly or else.”
“Yes sir,” he replied nervously.
With that, the mirror-masked clown left as well, vanishing into the corridors.
“Don’t worry about Orpheus,” Odile said “He can be a bit cold, but he’s rather sweet when you get to know him. I’m sure he’ll warm up to you with time.”
“I hope so,” Soren replied, though he felt that wouldn’t be the case.
“Hold on tight,” she said, shifting his weight. “It's curtain call, we’d best be going.”
“Do you really need to carry me?” He asked, somewhat embarrassed
“If I didn’t, you wouldn’t be able to keep up with us,” She replied matter-of-factly. Considering how quickly the aliens seemed to move, he couldn’t really argue with that. He just held on as his savior carried him away into the dark. He wasn’t sure where they were going or what they’d do when they got there, but he hoped that whatever it was, wherever it was, it would be better than the life he just left.",0,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=7633, result=""Cut this one in half because it got kinda long.

9,Advice,"Hey everyone. My dad was going to get married nearby next May, but a few weeks ago his mom got a terminal cancer diagnosis and now he's moving the wedding to her home town (10 hr drive from here). He's also bumping it up to mid February. He hasn't talked to me about any of it, I've just been getting updates from my sister.

I'm in college and that's mid-semester for me. Money is tight as is and I have midterms around that time, so I'm not sure I'm going to make it. I do want to make it, and but I'm hesitating to book the flight before all the information for next semester's classes is available. I know almost for a fact that my professors won't excuse me missing an exam for a wedding, even if it's the last time I'll see my grandma.  So for now I'm just sitting tight and waiting to get more information. 

Flight costs will probably go up so I'm thinking if I do end up having the chance to go I'll probably just drive down there the day before. Stay in the city for the day of the wedding, go see a national park about an hour south while I'm there, drive back Sunday. I don't want this to come off as a vacation or anything.

Hi,

long story short, i dislocated my left jaw joint. My dentist did the thingy, to put it back. Now, i keep hearing, it could happen again, as the ligaments in the jaw get stretched, and cant hold the head of the jaw in its place.

Is this permanent, or the ligaments do in fact, heal, and regain its original strenght, or at least, most of it. I know people, who dislocated their knees, and regained most of its original function. So i cant see why jaw ligaments, couldn't do the same. Iam betting on my youth to take care of this. As i'am in my early twenties.

19,AskNYC,"I’m having a debate with my BF on this. I’m of the mindset that as a renter, it’s unreasonable to expect my landlord/landlady to fix every single issue that isn’t outright affecting my quality of living. If I can, I should try to fix it myself. I also worry that bothering them too much will piss them off and make them more likely to raise rent when we renew.

My BF on the other hand thinks they are on the hook for everything and since we are paying them upcharged rent, we are essentially paying for a service on top of a place to live. 

Here are some instances of things I consider minor but my BF wanted to contact our landlord about: 

- a faucet that leaks around the base when the water is turned on due to a worn out o-ring

- a small stress crack in the outside pane of a window that hasn’t gotten larger in the 6 months we’ve lived here

 - a broken hinge on the pneumatic door closer for our balcony door (which I was able to fix, whoop!)

- a loose hinge on a kitchen cabinet door that makes it hang very slightly out of place (should be an easy fix but it hasn’t bothered me enough to get to it)

- a soap dispenser built into our kitchen sink that wasn’t pumping (another thing I fixed) 

- a broken mount for the kitchen sink sprayer so the thing would fall out and flop on it’s side after use (turned out the plastic cap to hold it in place broke, was a simple replacement) 

- wooden doors that require some jimmying to open/close due to the wood expanding when it’s hot

I get that it’s important to tell them about anything that could cause structural or longterm damage (ie - ceiling leaks, cracked pipes, etc) but I don’t think any of the above issues qualify. Granted, I am socially awkward and averse to confrontation, so maybe I am looking at this the wrong way.",0,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=1788, result='I’m having a debate with my BF on this.

For those of you running a photography business - how do you collect payment?

I understand many take a 50% deposit before a shoot - is that through e-transfer? What's the best way to collect ahead of time?

In addition, what about the remaining 50% or so after a shoot. Is it after you hand over the photos? Or let's say after you edited the photos and give them a gallery link with watermark, where they cannot download until they pay?

Is that the best idea? How do you collect payment thereafter as well?

Any general payment tips?

22,Assistance,"Backstory: I have been talking to a girl online for almost a year now. We have become pretty good friends. But there’s a catch… she really likes me. And when I say “really” I mean I think she’s obsessed with me and it’s a little strange to say the least. 

Now to provide some specific examples:

1). She will be sleeping, and then at a random point she will text me, as she woke up, because she didn’t reply to my latest text before she initially fell asleep. 
- The reason I think this is strange is because she literally wakes up at a random point during her sleep because she realized that she forgot to text me back. So to me, this shows a simple sign of obsession AND it shows that I am literally affecting her sleep schedule and her personal / mental health. 

2). She basically copies and throws back what I say back to me. So what I mean by that is I will say something with specific descriptive words like “wonderful, fantastic, amazing, great… the list goes on” and she will then say the same things to me. So a specific example is that I will say “I hope you had a wonderful and amazing sleep when you see this in the morning!” And then she will say, “I had a great sleep! I hope you had an amazing and wonderful sleep as well!” She will also use an emoji that I always used for specific sentences and then use it in the same type of sentence that I would use but she sends it to me. If that’s makes sense. 
- I know these examples seem silly, but its just another thing that I observe. 

3). A few months ago we took a break from texting each other. So after awhile she texts me telling me that she misses me and misses all that we had together. This really through me for a loop because she said stuff that, again, made me think there is a sense of obsession. So the specific example I have is that she told me “I miss the times where we would talk all night and text for hours. I miss the stupid conversations we had. I have actually found myself crying thinking about them. I constantly have you on my mind and thinking about you makes me sad. I just wish we could be together irl”. 
- Fine, this is flattering to read, I will admit that.. But I can’t help but observe a sense of obsession here. She literally cries thinking about me. Do I have to say anything more? 

4). She already has a list of things to do if we were to meet irl. Examples are “go roller skating, watch movies all night, snuggle, bake together, go on walks….” And those are just some of the things that she told me. I asked her if those are all of them, and she said “No😌”. 
- I know that it is a good thing to plan ahead, as I do myself, but to me, this, again, shows signs of obsession with the idea that she already has these plans for if  we were to meet irl .

So in summary, those are some specific examples that I can think of. To me, these are simple and clear signs of obsession when it comes to her thoughts and opinions about me. Maybe it’s just me being me and overthinking it and such, but it just seems too weird. ESPECIALLY. ( I need to emphasize this) she is 16, i am 19 and I am her first “boyfriend” if I am referred to as that by her. Or if I’m not, I am her first “indirect boyfriend”. Which is what I am thinking that I am to her.

Hi. I'm a 21 year old trans woman. I'm interested in doing a roleplay playing a celebrity as trans.

The basic plot I had in mind was this one:

Things have been much easier than you thought after your son came out as trans. Now you had a happy, talented and beautiful daughter, and your family seems stronger than ever.

But slowly you start noticing something. Your daughter maybe is becoming *too* beautiful for you. Slowly you start feeling something different for her. Will you manage to hide these feelings for her, or your lust will win over?

The celebrities I would like to play using this plot are: Emma Watson, Emma Stone, Ariana Grande, Brie Larson, Miranda Cosgrove, Jeanette McCurdy, Elizabeth Gillies, Margot Robbie, Alexandra Daddario, Yanet Garcia, Vanessa Hudgens, Jordyn Jones, Kat Dennings, Elizabeth Olsen, Barbara Palvin, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams or Daisy Ridley. I accept suggestions as well. 

If you want, I can play the celebrity before or after their reassignment surgery, if you don't feel fully comfortable with me playing them with a penis.

Visibility is getting exceedingly low after the first vantage point. Brittle, limestone covers the precipice. Headlamps and spotlights flicker violently across some extreme locations from our initial starting point. Thermal scanners prove futile across the same unidentified areas, we are hovering around closely on the edges of our initial point.

The only problem palpable is low visibility due to some kind of nebulous fog sojourning around the edges, wandering alone without carrying a multivariate analysis on the known surface is very dangerous for few regions on the extreme westward side of the caves have almost, acute declination and ghastly deformities. The cave roof tilts perilously close to the edges of these surfaces. The entrance to the cave was surrounded by few delirious villagers, complaining of perturbing the natural vegetation as translated by our local companion. Later as we shew no signs of retreating, our entreats finally gave way. By then we were already past our mark. However, the villagers chose to linger around the cave for unfathomable purposes, eventually retreating to their shacks on the outskirts as evening drew closer.

Immediately local workers working on the far ends of the cave system spotted certain, distinct cave paintings, what proceeded next amused my senses to a great bit, for some workers were seemingly repelled by the prehistoric ramblings, and immediately expressed wishes of abandoning that part of the labyrinth altogether. What frightened them to this extent I knew scarcely of for, I was given the tedious responsibility of studying the geometry. Hushed utterances of terrified workers filled the corridors, some even compared the deities in the petroglyphs to the hideous Hindu god, 'Hastur'. Further, in the corridors, our finds manager's team which consisted of six members including two students suggested some great findings  further ahead in the cave system.
 

Furthermore while progressing in the only direction hitherto suitable for trudging, one of the students from the find's manager division reported back enthralling news. Unbelievable alcove like structure was slightly visible, after moving linearly westward by hugging the cave walls for about 250m, these rock structures manifested into much greater sculptures, entirely man-made, this revelation sent a wave of nervous exultation. Immediately after carefully securing those artifacts, we contacted our site manager, Abigail who upon receiving the impeccable news wasted no time in wiring our director and head of our division, who in turn congratulated on our early success, having been run on a sufficiently low budget, possibility of finding something this perfect in a condition so early in our exploration was a rare occurrence and baffled our finds manager, Viktor to great extent, chances of a random cave-in were sufficiently low, relative tundra was sufficiently on high altitude as well, conversely, some parts of the cave as scanned by our thermal scanner revealed data of great interest, some parts while sufficiently inside the cave had a steady, almost acute declination in temperature while others like the area near our vantage points shew no such anomalies and a linear declination in  temperature was recorded.

Abnormal variations around the trove and steep declination in the pit 

140m from inception. Steep descent.

June 21, 85

The exploring team yesterday did a rather meticulous and tremendous job of exploring the much dreaded westward side of the cave, and then only way past our deadline 300m from our initial descent were we able to very safely gather some of the ostentatious artifacts. All the while workers on the extreme ends of the perimeter recorded uncanny data, for lichens like substance, extremely slippery, and emanating a putrid smell adhered to the adjoining walls of the cave and much of the surface, making walking nearly impossible, and a much dangerous task. 

Precarious and rather intelligent rock structures on the far ends of the corridor were immediately identified and secured by workers, however great precision and precaution had to be taken due to the alarmingly ponderous nature of the artifacts. As of the initial condition of the artifact, we were left wondering in awe for the conditions of the artefacts, of the seemingly ebony, stone structures were impeccable. Not a case of mechanical erosion had affected, and the impact of rolling or weathered erosion was absent throughout, like everything the same gelatinous slimy molds covered the entire region of the walls near the sepulcher and much of the artifacts. Only a prolonged treatment of the various materials and structures plagued by the unidentified sticky, gelatinous substance was needed in the laboratory. The presence of any kind of salt was rather astoundingly low and this meant a low amount of salt crystal formation. 

Even today, some village folks gathered on the entrance to our dig site today but left much earlier, of their intention I have no clue of. 

After only a steady, ascension of around 90m further westward, the limestone stalagmites got dangerously close and were distinctly visible. Some organic materials similar to the ones around the initial trove covered the precipice as well and was only identified when one of the heavier materials dropped without any prior notice on steekman's headgear. Careful investigation of the slimy mold gives us the idea of some kind of animal excreta, preferably mammals, for these placental creatures hovering around in limestone caves are a common occurrence. The only concern projected by Gavin, the geoarchaeology manager of our division, pointed out of the low visibility, for visibility reduced drastically after 30ft above us, such darkness was impenetrable and rendered our 120 watt headlamps useless. Workers working in the far ends of the cave now started complaining vehemently of a noxious smell emanating from the queer sepulcher and from the great abyss.

All the while some other workers of our division complained of the same slimy mold like organic material dripping from the cave's precipice as well. Whilst some even complained of a 
nauseating smell arising from the stone sculptures, whilst others reported strange radiance and heat radiating from the same sepulcher which harboured most of our miniature findings. 

After a careful thermal scan of the abhorred stop, as termed by some men of ours in extreme delirium after even reporting seeing some voluntary movement in the miniature statues interesting details were recorded. The moldy, gelatinous like materials covering the entire range of the cave walls on the west side before the steep descent, itself radiated some sort of intense heat radiation. Long presence beside the alcove and the trove put some of our men as well as the village folks to extreme fatigue and some even complained of nausea, local workers from the surrounding villages spoke in hushed speeches no more and presented their contempt in some foreign languages in sheer unison, henceforth the dreaded miniature statue of the seemingly, strikingly similar looking as of the abhorred Hindu deity, 'Hastur' as exclaimed by one of the more timid student from our find manager's team. It was abandoned not only by the village folks but even workers from our division discarded it. For standing a trifle close to the portent aroused nausea according to them. Of this, I cannot vouch, for their fear alone induced a feeling of obnoxious uneasiness and guaranteed an appreciable distance from the supposed spectre. 

Now, we must begin the fearful descent, fearful not because I dread but fearful because some men of both from our division as well some of the village folks repeat dreadfully of some accursed legend in the dank abyss that we must never set foot on. It is down there, we must find findings which will enhance our erudition, it is down there that our real discovery awaits, in the dank corridors of this aeon-lost, centuries sealed and aeon-forgotten cave systems. Today we must shun those who are delirious, fearful, or even sceptical, for we are only but a trifle away from unearthing a culture vastly forgotten and buried under thousand years of weathered storm.

Mental state is in doldrums**

*""Fear is the mother of morals""*

Bear in mind closely that it is only the further cave-ins that I suspect and fear and neither the groaning of that nameless entity, nameless for I have only a little recollection and knowledge of that and nor the wailings of my own crew members deter or even frighten me. In our mad pursuit of the historic may god forbade us, for we displayed such dumbness and folly stupidity I would not like to wish upon even on my nemesis. Bear in mind a singular thing more, for even in my mad dash toward the inner sanctum of this cave, where I now reside so blissfully aware of my imminent demise, I did not see any actual horror save for those eyes, hundreds of them, even more, oh god! those eyes, we witnessed those at the inception of our excavation but such blinding faith and under a prosaic spell of the dreary job, were we ever to take something so spectral of a thing into account? hahaha hahaha.

I can see these horrid eyes now, leering down at me, mocking me. The cave bellows in laughter, IN A RESPONSE TO MY OWN. A stupid, stupid I would say, stupid thing to do to further enrage a 
person wholly drowned in its own seas of visual horrors his brain has to subject him to. I now would like to think of the village folks who joined in our blasphemous venture, for what? hahaha!. I can now understand their furtiveness when around those slimy materials, and when around the hideous figurine of the Hindu deity, Hastur. They were the first to descent and the first to ascent, hahaha! such random and timely dismantling of a cave, may god forbade shall not occur to any, the reason for the dismantling I have no clue of. I am still unable to comprehend such a disastrous consequence, for very securely and tediously we had begun our descent and it was with utmost security we began walking on the hideous surface. 

At first, I'm not sure, details are fuzzy and blear, why would not they be? I just escaped the wraith of an unnameable entity, which is still wandering around these labyrinths, around these roofs, around these horrid corridors. I think I might have enough of a deadline to document everything, deadlines are imperative in our field of expertise. I might embark my story but as I say this bear in mind just a trifle bit more, I might not be able to finish this, and if so this journal is ever recovered under this impious debris, men of science and fellow excavators alike will be tempted to discard, disregard, and might go on at length to even call this a hoax but it is only with the grace of God and on the mercy of that stupid being am I able to write this and not under any circumstance this journal might be disregarded or be called a hoax.

As it is clear and very straightforward extractable from my earlier notes, on the day of June 21, on the edge of the Yucatan peninsula. Today we were meant to descent further in the secretive Mexican caves. Having been previously successfully secured various relics, we started our further descent in rather  high spirit save for some dubious village folks and some sick men from our division who were quite vehemently opposing the digging and even asked for re-shift. In the mad pursuit of un-earthing ghastly secrets we let nothing deter us and even under the absence of few workers we descended down the abyss. It was then I suspect something preternatural of the most supernal nature was at work, at first, some of the local workers shouted, followed by a scream of the most hideous kind. It was Matt, and his daemonic screech is how I suspect something spectacularly supernatural was at play, for there resided in his guttural scream, an awe of the most curious nature. For you see, there is a normal scream, in a normal person's scream, of a singular male, you don't go on to hear helplessness, dread, fear, curiosity and even surprise, no. In that unnatural moment of panic, again I say, I wasn't subjected to any visual horror until the very end. At once I feared the worst, only a singular question reverberated in my mind, how did this happen! I believe most of the men from our division and of the villagers which we recruited immediately perished under the falling debris, and if not then the further excavation hazards must have secured their untimely demise. At some points, I even heard metallic clanks, curious thuds on metallic pipes, steel plates falling, and then silence, the sound of settling debris and the complex haze of confusion, fear, stupidity, humor. Yes, even humor. I wouldn't wanna lie, why would I? It will only be suitable if I tell everything as it was and without any touch of mystery or exaggeration. 

The whole of the front portion of cave descended down upon us, I'm not sure of any survivors but in the distance beneath gravel, dirt and debris I can hear screams, but I can sense astonishment in their speeches as well. Only this was enough to deter me from even going beyond that hindrance, beyond that wall of debris. Note that, If I was built like the lord himself or even had some supernatural powers of my own, even then I would have floundered in front of those gigantic boulders covering my exit, and even then to climb the steep wall would have been a drudgerous task in itself. I knew not what nature of spell came upon me for in the face of death, call it my callous behavior or haughty demeanor I was unnaturally calm, at peace even.

What propelled me through that abyss further more into those hideous away from our work area into these dismal corridors of death is anyone's guess but to say I escaped unscathed, was unharmed would be a lie. From fear or from the delicate wound oozing a dangerous amount of blood from my head, I'm not entirely sure what caused me to faint for it was as sudden and quick as the collapse of our dig site. 

Sleep came as a deliverance if only for a jiff, but in that merciful period of time floating betwixt maddening labyrinths of my transient daze, I sought out many wonders than the city's haze. Under a moonless sky and in the vast unfathomable plains of sheer nothingness, I met a singular deity, of whom I can describe with just visions and no lore and only that ensued respite from my unending fright and nothing more.

How would you deny subconscious, yes! the subconscious mind. How would you deny it? How would you deny the unceasing urge to explore what further these damp corridors held within them, even when some inexplicable sound as of some ancient monstrosity as in under unspeakable pain was scarcely audible, the type of sound one wouldn't expect in a cave shunned of for a thousand and one years I found it impossible to deny the perpetual urge to seek what these dank caverns held, what they hid? For death was imminent, and the only way to seek merciful oblivion.

At first, I must tell you of the paintings that I saw, I like to believe that it was only the half luminescence of the flashlight and half shadow of my own body which fell upon those paintings and made them appear even more hideous for you see, in my several years of being an Archaeologist myself only once before I felt extreme terror, only once, you see. Even then I was in the merciful company of my fellow observers, but what I saw there was a complex mixture, a disproportionate compound of everything that is unwelcoming, unwholesome, and ghastly.

What are these paintings but only a reflection of the culture, only a reflection of their dreams and their thoughts? From what I have gathered from the innumerable accounts I have read, of the numerous books I have galloped in my years of erudition only scarcely I have witnessed painting depicting true fear, unadulterated terror. From what I saw I could only derive this singular conclusion. Years ago, I'm quite unsure about it for, in a normal chain of events, uranium-thorium dating would have been conducted on these specimens as well as these rocks to find out the exact age. This cave art I believe must go as far as 24,000 years old. In the very first of these prehistoric arts that I stumbled upon it was all but a representation of a ritual altar inside similar looking caves, not much queer. Further up the cave wall another one of this petroglyph shew what must have been some kind of enormous mammal but its entire anatomy, I'm not in a position to derive conclusions from these paintings, queer was its entire structure, for although its enormous size, its wings as in the art was of even greater stature.

Its shape was very uncanny, cloud-like and it was levitating, an animal or bird, I can't quite fathom but irrespective of its class how was it to float with such gigantic body proportion was a deeply ponderous subject, its lower body was all but a terrifying example of evolution. For instead of legs there, numerous tentacles structure projected out of its lower body. Of its intelligence, I had little clue of. 

What bothered me the most at first was what I believed a misrepresentation of the creature's eyes, there were hundreds of those maddening eyes, leering straight down at those helpless people. Hundreds of them, yes! hundreds of those eyes, even thousand I'm not quite sure for I said the visibility was getting alarmingly low. Even then the painting wasn't carried out in much detail Further as I sauntered on the precarious ledge now blissfully aware of certain things more of those harrowing paintings came into view, In some, I swear I thought I even saw wanderers bearing striking similarities to us, no headlamps and modern gears with them of course. Whilst in some the monstrosity was being worshipped whilst in some of the arts the figures seemed to defend themselves throwing pebbles, javelins but what are these tidbits to a deranged monster like that. 

At length I found myself standing across another spectacular find which fellow researchers and archaeologist like me would have been tempted to explore so here I'm exempting the tempting details of the find but now I know what forbade our own workers from working near those figurines, vile organic liquid covered the entire surface, at once I found myself uttering curses of unfathomable origins. I'm not talking out of my wits here for you must see I even remember our coordinates, I remember every detail of our trip. It is not I'm going insane or I'm even mildly hallucinating but believe me, when I say that liquid was some sort of excreta, saliva at best, not human, emanating such odious odor I have little doubt over its origin. 

Only further ahead on the cave path the ominous reality choked my neck, strangled my breaths, and only further ahead on the cave path is the reason I forbade anyone from re-digging on this land of nebulous horror. 

Further, as I walked through the squalid floor, once again I would like to remind you I'm not under any kind of stupor, NEITHER I was then nor am I suffering from any drug-induced hallucination. There without any delay, I would like to say what I found was the extremity of what is hideous, unpleasant, and unbelievable. Unbelievable at most, at best.

At first, I checked my nerves, yes I did! for sometimes high blood pressure, or excessive anxiety I believe can induce hallucination as well. No abnormalities there. I feel no shame in dictating what I did next, the last straw which sent me running down to where I am now. In a dream I raced back through the same precarious ledges which earlier I crossed with much perseverance. Better to fall and perish than to suffer endlessly in a cloud of persistent dread, only if god shew any kind of mercy I would have perished there and then. 

Reasonable of you are free to reason with my statement and comment on my shameful course of a run, say that I might be overthinking, or running parallel with my anxiety, but to say my reaction was anything but involuntary will of course not do justice. I found myself standing over an abyssal pit, common in these kinds of caves, the sound of that monstrosity, the baying was the loudest there and the smell was suffocating. What bothered me was the sheer stature of the pit and the colossal width, even that is justifiable under lack of proper measuring tools and other instruments as I have said already numerous times visibility was low so it could have been some sort of wicked illusion but even it is not that, which at first confused me and then sent me racing like a mad hound. 

There as I looked into the pit with my flashlight tiny....orbs like things reflected back the light at first I thought to flee for an altogether different reason. Bats! for I thought bats for some peculiar reason instead of the cave roofs decided to settle on the pit but only a singular oddity erased every merciful assumption my deranged mind had to offer.

They all blinked simultaneously in sheer unison, unanimously! they all blinked. There as once again I fixated my gaze on the queer abyss, it lit up, through hundred of...orbs? At first, it seemed like orbs, then I applied the vestiges of sanity left in me...just like flashes of tube lights, flashlights even. It blinkedagain...thousand of flashes at once, like eyes...it BLINKED!....yes it blinked like eyes. Eyes! the paintings, the creature in those hideous paintings, the baying and the saliva all around me, this cave! is it a cave? or is it...is it..

ONCE AGAIN! the cave erupted with what I can only comprehend as laughter, plain laughter erupted in whole of that confined space. An inhuman laughter, of the most animalistic kind mocking a very distinct human emotion, ""happiness"". 

At once, the remnants of what was sanity propelled me through that horrendous course of path, through those same corridors of insanity. At once, I ran like a mad hound, like some sort of carnivore running behind a fleeting group of prey. Baying is very faint now and almost ceases here, even the laughter, although for the noxious smell I can't utter the same for. If only to perish remains on my fate then it is with a heavy heart and a foreboding fear I derive this hideous conclusion, my return to that accursed pit is eminent. For I must find out whatever plagues these plains, this cave.

Steep descent.\n\nJune 20, 85\n\nVisibility is getting exceedingly low after the first vantage point. Brittle, limestone covers the precipice. Headlamps and spotlights flicker violently across some extreme locations from our initial starting point. Thermal scanners prove futile across the same unidentified areas, we are hovering around closely on the edges of our initial point.\n\nThe only problem palpable is low visibility due to some kind of nebulous fog sojourning around the edges, wandering alone without carrying a multivariate analysis on the known surface is very dangerous for few regions on the extreme westward side of the caves have almost, acute declination and ghastly deformities. The cave roof tilts perilously close to the edges of these surfaces. The entrance to the cave was surrounded by few delirious villagers, complaining of perturbing the natural vegetation as translated by our local companion. Later as we shew no signs of retreating, our entreats finally gave way. By then we were already past our mark. However, the villagers chose to linger around the cave for unfathomable purposes, eventually retreating to their shacks on the outskirts as evening drew closer.\n\nImmediately local workers working on the far ends of the cave system spotted certain, distinct cave paintings, what proceeded next amused my senses to a great bit, for some workers were seemingly repelled by the prehistoric ramblings, and immediately expressed wishes of abandoning that part of the labyrinth altogether. What frightened them to this extent I knew scarcely of for, I was given the tedious responsibility of studying the geometry. Hushed utterances of terrified workers filled the corridors, some even compared the deities in the petroglyphs to the hideous Hindu god, \'Hastur\'. Further, in the corridors, our finds manager\'s team which consisted of six members including two students suggested some great findings  further ahead in the cave system.\n \n\nFurthermore while progressing in the only direction hitherto suitable for trudging, one of the students from the find\'s manager division reported back enthralling news. Unbelievable alcove like structure was slightly visible, after moving linearly westward by hugging the cave walls for about 250m, these rock structures manifested into much greater sculptures, entirely man-made, this revelation sent a wave of nervous exultation. Immediately after carefully securing those artifacts, we contacted our site manager, Abigail who upon receiving the impeccable news wasted no time in wiring our director and head of our division, who in turn congratulated on our early success, having been run on a sufficiently low budget, possibility of finding something this perfect in a condition so early in our exploration was a rare occurrence and baffled our finds manager, Viktor to great extent, chances of a random cave-in were sufficiently low, relative tundra was sufficiently on high altitude as well, conversely, some parts of the cave as scanned by our thermal scanner revealed data of great interest, some parts while sufficiently inside the cave had a steady, almost acute declination in temperature while others like the area near our vantage points shew no such anomalies and a linear declination in  temperature was recorded.\n\n18.8067° N, 89.3985° W\n\nSteady temperature, 21 c maintained.\n\nAbnormal variations around the trove and steep declination in the pit \n\n140m from inception. Steep descent.\n\nJune 21, 85\n\nThe exploring team yesterday did a rather meticulous and tremendous job of exploring the much dreaded westward side of the cave, and then only way past our deadline 300m from our initial descent were we able to very safely gather some of the ostentatious artifacts. All the while workers on the extreme ends of the perimeter recorded uncanny data, for lichens like substance, extremely slippery, and emanating a putrid smell adhered to the adjoining walls of the cave and much of the surface, making walking nearly impossible, and a much dangerous task. \n\nPrecarious and rather intelligent rock structures on the far ends of the corridor were immediately identified and secured by workers, however great precision and precaution had to be taken due to the alarmingly ponderous nature of the artifacts. As of the initial condition of the artifact, we were left wondering in awe for the conditions of the artefacts, of the seemingly ebony, stone structures were impeccable. Not a case of mechanical erosion had affected, and the impact of rolling or weathered erosion was absent throughout, like everything the same gelatinous slimy molds covered the entire region of the walls near the sepulcher and much of the artifacts. Only a prolonged treatment of the various materials and structures plagued by the unidentified sticky, gelatinous substance was needed in the laboratory. The presence of any kind of salt was rather astoundingly low and this meant a low amount of salt crystal formation. \n\nEven today, some village folks gathered on the entrance to our dig site today but left much earlier, of their intention I have no clue of. \n\nAfter only a steady, ascension of around 90m further westward, the limestone stalagmites got dangerously close and were distinctly visible. Some organic materials similar to the ones around the initial trove covered the precipice as well and was only identified when one of the heavier materials dropped without any prior notice on steekman\'s headgear. Careful investigation of the slimy mold gives us the idea of some kind of animal excreta, preferably mammals, for these placental creatures hovering around in limestone caves are a common occurrence. The only concern projected by Gavin, the geoarchaeology manager of our division, pointed out of the low visibility, for visibility reduced drastically after 30ft above us, such darkness was impenetrable and rendered our 120 watt headlamps useless. Workers working in the far ends of the cave now started complaining vehemently of a noxious smell emanating from the queer sepulcher and from the great abyss.\n\nAll the while some other workers of our division complained of the same slimy mold like organic material dripping from the cave\'s precipice as well. Whilst some even complained of a \nnauseating smell arising from the stone sculptures, whilst others reported strange radiance and heat radiating from the same sepulcher which harboured most of our miniature findings. \n\nAfter a careful thermal scan of the abhorred stop, as termed by some men of ours in extreme delirium after even reporting seeing some voluntary movement in the miniature statues interesting details were recorded. The moldy, gelatinous like materials covering the entire range of the cave walls on the west side before the steep descent, itself radiated some sort of intense heat radiation. Long presence beside the alcove and the trove put some of our men as well as the village folks to extreme fatigue and some even complained of nausea, local workers from the surrounding villages spoke in hushed speeches no more and presented their contempt in some foreign languages in sheer unison, henceforth the dreaded miniature statue of the seemingly, strikingly similar looking as of the abhorred Hindu deity, \'Hastur\' as exclaimed by one of the more timid student from our find manager\'s team. It was abandoned not only by the village folks but even workers from our division discarded it. For standing a trifle close to the portent aroused nausea according to them. Of this, I cannot vouch, for their fear alone induced a feeling of obnoxious uneasiness and guaranteed an appreciable distance from the supposed spectre. \n\nNow, we must begin the fearful descent, fearful not because I dread but fearful because some men of both from our division as well some of the village folks repeat dreadfully of some accursed legend in the dank abyss that we must never set foot on. It is down there, we must find findings which will enhance our erudition, it is down there that our real discovery awaits, in the dank corridors of this aeon-lost, centuries sealed and aeon-forgotten cave systems. Today we must shun those who are delirious, fearful, or even sceptical, for we are only but a trifle away from unearthing a culture vastly forgotten and buried under thousand years of weathered storm.\n\n18.8067° N, 89.3985° W\n\nTemperature unknown \n\n**Can\'t figure out anything else \nMental state is in doldrums**\n\nJune 22, 85\n\n*""Fear is the mother of morals""*\n\nBear in mind closely that it is only the further cave-ins that I suspect and fear and neither the groaning of that nameless entity, nameless for I have only a little recollection and knowledge of that and nor the wailings of my own crew members deter or even frighten me. In our mad pursuit of the historic may god forbade us, for we displayed such dumbness and folly stupidity I would not like to wish upon even on my nemesis. Bear in mind a singular thing more, for even in my mad dash toward the inner sanctum of this cave, where I now reside so blissfully aware of my imminent demise, I did not see any actual horror save for those eyes, hundreds of them, even more, oh god! those eyes, we witnessed those at the inception of our excavation but such blinding faith and under a prosaic spell of the dreary job, were we ever to take something so spectral of a thing into account? hahaha hahaha.\n\nI can see these horrid eyes now, leering down at me, mocking me. The cave bellows in laughter, IN A RESPONSE TO MY OWN. A stupid, stupid I would say, stupid thing to do to further enrage a \nperson wholly drowned in its own seas of visual horrors his brain has to subject him to. I now would like to think of the village folks who joined in our blasphemous venture, for what? hahaha!. I can now understand their furtiveness when around those slimy materials, and when around the hideous figurine of the Hindu deity, Hastur. They were the first to descent and the first to ascent, hahaha! such random and timely dismantling of a cave, may god forbade shall not occur to any, the reason for the dismantling I have no clue of. I am still unable to comprehend such a disastrous consequence, for very securely and tediously we had begun our descent and it was with utmost security we began walking on the hideous surface. \n\nAt first, I\'m not sure, details are fuzzy and blear, why would not they be? I just escaped the wraith of an unnameable entity, which is still wandering around these labyrinths, around these roofs, around these horrid corridors. I think I might have enough of a deadline to document everything, deadlines are imperative in our field of expertise. I might embark my story but as I say this bear in mind just a trifle bit more, I might not be able to finish this, and if so this journal is ever recovered under this impious debris, men of science and fellow excavators alike will be tempted to discard, disregard, and might go on at length to even call this a hoax but it is only with the grace of God and on the mercy of that stupid being am I able to write this and not under any circumstance this journal might be disregarded or be called a hoax.\n\nAs it is clear and very straightforward extractable from my earlier notes, on the day of June 21, on the edge of the Yucatan peninsula. Today we were meant to descent further in the secretive Mexican caves. Having been previously successfully secured various relics, we started our further descent in rather  high spirit save for some dubious village folks and some sick men from our division who were quite vehemently opposing the digging and even asked for re-shift. In the mad pursuit of un-earthing ghastly secrets we let nothing deter us and even under the absence of few workers we descended down the abyss. It was then I suspect something preternatural of the most supernal nature was at work, at first, some of the local workers shouted, followed by a scream of the most hideous kind. It was Matt, and his daemonic screech is how I suspect something spectacularly supernatural was at play, for there resided in his guttural scream, an awe of the most curious nature. For you see, there is a normal scream, in a normal person\'s scream, of a singular male, you don\'t go on to hear helplessness, dread, fear, curiosity and even surprise, no. In that unnatural moment of panic, again I say, I wasn\'t subjected to any visual horror until the very end. At once I feared the worst, only a singular question reverberated in my mind, how did this happen! I believe most of the men from our division and of the villagers which we recruited immediately perished under the falling debris, and if not then the further excavation hazards must have secured their untimely demise. At some points, I even heard metallic clanks, curious thuds on metallic pipes, steel plates falling, and then silence, the sound of settling debris and the complex haze of confusion, fear, stupidity, humor. Yes, even humor. I wouldn\'t wanna lie, why would I? It will only be suitable if I tell everything as it was and without any touch of mystery or exaggeration. \n\nThe whole of the front portion of cave descended down upon us, I\'m not sure of any survivors but in the distance beneath gravel, dirt and debris I can hear screams, but I can sense astonishment in their speeches as well. Only this was enough to deter me from even going beyond that hindrance, beyond that wall of debris. Note that, If I was built like the lord himself or even had some supernatural powers of my own, even then I would have floundered in front of those gigantic boulders covering my exit, and even then to climb the steep wall would have been a drudgerous task in itself. I knew not what nature of spell came upon me for in the face of death, call it my callous behavior or haughty demeanor I was unnaturally calm, at peace even.\n\nWhat propelled me through that abyss further more into those hideous away from our work area into these dismal corridors of death is anyone\'s guess but to say I escaped unscathed, was unharmed would be a lie. From fear or from the delicate wound oozing a dangerous amount of blood from my head, I\'m not entirely sure what caused me to faint for it was as sudden and quick as the collapse of our dig site. \n\nSleep came as a deliverance if only for a jiff, but in that merciful period of time floating betwixt maddening labyrinths of my transient daze, I sought out many wonders than the city\'s haze. Under a moonless sky and in the vast unfathomable plains of sheer nothingness, I met a singular deity, of whom I can describe with just visions and no lore and only that ensued respite from my unending fright and nothing more.\n\nHow would you deny subconscious, yes! the subconscious mind. How would you deny it? How would you deny the unceasing urge to explore what further these damp corridors held within them, even when some inexplicable sound as of some ancient monstrosity as in under unspeakable pain was scarcely audible, the type of sound one wouldn\'t expect in a cave shunned of for a thousand and one years I found it impossible to deny the perpetual urge to seek what these dank caverns held, what they hid? For death was imminent, and the only way to seek merciful oblivion.\n\nAt first, I must tell you of the paintings that I saw, I like to believe that it was only the half luminescence of the flashlight and half shadow of my own body which fell upon those paintings and made them appear even more hideous for you see, in my several years of being an Archaeologist myself only once before I felt extreme terror, only once, you see. Even then I was in the merciful company of my fellow observers, but what I saw there was a complex mixture, a disproportionate compound of everything that is unwelcoming, unwholesome, and ghastly.\n\nWhat are these paintings but only a reflection of the culture, only a reflection of their dreams and their thoughts? From what I have gathered from the innumerable accounts I have read, of the numerous books I have galloped in my years of erudition only scarcely I have witnessed painting depicting true fear, unadulterated terror. From what I saw I could only derive this singular conclusion. Years ago, I\'m quite unsure about it for, in a normal chain of events, uranium-thorium dating would have been conducted on these specimens as well as these rocks to find out the exact age. This cave art I believe must go as far as 24,000 years old. In the very first of these prehistoric arts that I stumbled upon it was all but a representation of a ritual altar inside similar looking caves, not much queer. Further up the cave wall another one of this petroglyph shew what must have been some kind of enormous mammal but its entire anatomy, I\'m not in a position to derive conclusions from these paintings, queer was its entire structure, for although its enormous size, its wings as in the art was of even greater stature.\n\nIts shape was very uncanny, cloud-like and it was levitating, an animal or bird, I can\'t quite fathom but irrespective of its class how was it to float with such gigantic body proportion was a deeply ponderous subject, its lower body was all but a terrifying example of evolution. For instead of legs there, numerous tentacles structure projected out of its lower body. Of its intelligence, I had little clue of. \n\nWhat bothered me the most at first was what I believed a misrepresentation of the creature\'s eyes, there were hundreds of those maddening eyes, leering straight down at those helpless people. Hundreds of them, yes! hundreds of those eyes, even thousand I\'m not quite sure for I said the visibility was getting alarmingly low. Even then the painting wasn\'t carried out in much detail Further as I sauntered on the precarious ledge now blissfully aware of certain things more of those harrowing paintings came into view, In some, I swear I thought I even saw wanderers bearing striking similarities to us, no headlamps and modern gears with them of course. Whilst in some the monstrosity was being worshipped whilst in some of the arts the figures seemed to defend themselves throwing pebbles, javelins but what are these tidbits to a deranged monster like that. \n\nAt length I found myself standing across another spectacular find which fellow researchers and archaeologist like me would have been tempted to explore so here I\'m exempting the tempting details of the find but now I know what forbade our own workers from working near those figurines, vile organic liquid covered the entire surface, at once I found myself uttering curses of unfathomable origins. I\'m not talking out of my wits here for you must see I even remember our coordinates, I remember every detail of our trip. It is not I\'m going insane or I\'m even mildly hallucinating but believe me, when I say that liquid was some sort of excreta, saliva at best, not human, emanating such odious odor I have little doubt over its origin. \n\nOnly further ahead on the cave path the ominous reality choked my neck, strangled my breaths, and only further ahead on the cave path is the reason I forbade anyone from re-digging on this land of nebulous horror. \n\nFurther, as I walked through the squalid floor, once again I would like to remind you I\'m not under any kind of stupor, NEITHER I was then nor am I suffering from any drug-induced hallucination. There without any delay, I would like to say what I found was the extremity of what is hideous, unpleasant, and unbelievable. Unbelievable at most, at best.\n\nAt first, I checked my nerves, yes I did! for sometimes high blood pressure, or excessive anxiety I believe can induce hallucination as well. No abnormalities there. I feel no shame in dictating what I did next, the last straw which sent me running down to where I am now. In a dream I raced back through the same precarious ledges which earlier I crossed with much perseverance. Better to fall and perish than to suffer endlessly in a cloud of persistent dread, only if god shew any kind of mercy I would have perished there and then. \n\nReasonable of you are free to reason with my statement and comment on my shameful course of a run, say that I might be overthinking, or running parallel with my anxiety, but to say my reaction was anything but involuntary will of course not do justice. I found myself standing over an abyssal pit, common in these kinds of caves, the sound of that monstrosity, the baying was the loudest there and the smell was suffocating. What bothered me was the sheer stature of the pit and the colossal width, even that is justifiable under lack of proper measuring tools and other instruments as I have said already numerous times visibility was low so it could have been some sort of wicked illusion but even it is not that, which at first confused me and then sent me racing like a mad hound. \n\nThere as I looked into the pit with my flashlight tiny....orbs like things reflected back the light at first I thought to flee for an altogether different reason.

58,CryptoMoonCoins,"\# What is EverGain?

EverGain is a Hyper-Deflationary Token with Integrated Rebase and Instant BUSD Rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

\# BUSD Rewards 💸

With every transaction there’s a tax associated with it. 7% is taxed for the purpose of our BUSD rewards system. Unlike other coins the holders will get their rewards instantly and automatically, with no need for claiming or waiting.

&amp;#x200B;

\# Anti-Price Manipulation ❌

Our anti-price manipulation system includes: Anti-Whale, Anti-Dump, Anti-Bot, Anti-Rugpull, Anti-Spam and Sell-Multiplier. This ensures security for all holders by stopping excessively large buys and sells that aim to manipulate the price in favour of whales and bots. Every transaction can only be made fairly for all parties involved.

&amp;#x200B;

\# Rebase 📈

Rebase is an effective burn strategy where we can reduce the supply of the token to increase the price. This allows us to create a healthy, EverGaining chart which attracts new investors allowing us to reach bigger milestones in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

\# Tokenomics ✔️

7% - BUSD Rewards

A significant part of my dream involved walking and running around in a towel. The dream first started in my home, where i argued with parents and threatened to kick them out if they moved my things without permission again, while the landlord’s son and girlfriend were present (never met the latter in real life). Then, through a series of strange events, which i can’t remember, i ended up wearing nothing but a towel and tried to go back to my room to put on clothes. However, when i tried to do that, i was teleported to a corridor in  a school building, with one end leading to some kind of stadium. I looked at the stadium and realized how big it was. Running across it would expose me to too many people, when i only had a towel to cover myself. I went the other way and asked different people to help me contact my family by phone, but they all ignored me. Some even looked annoyed. Without a choice, i ran across the stadium, while a football team was playing. Not sure why i chose that route. Anyway, i got out of the school and found myself standing on the track field of my elementary school. I found it desolate and rundown, completely different from what i remember. I asked around and learned that the school was got on the bad side of the government and was shut down. Note that i hate my elementary school in real life.

my body feels like it's wilting, taking a walk haven't helped as I can only think about how I instead should be studying.   


Two of my exams were shit, one of them only had 4 questions, 2 of them were topics not listed as a part of the curriculum. It was something that we had learned a few semesters ago, so I can understand that we should know it and am okay with it being a part of the test, but not 30%. 

I feel completely alone and isolated, or like a trapped animal, even if I were to leave the confines of my dorm I am unable to leave the confines of my head. ""I should be studying"" runs like Norton in the back of my head.

I'm not alone here in this QoL feature that wouldn't take much to add back in as an option.

It used to be a ""glitch"" and got taken out. Wanted to see how many people would appreciate having an option to use a higher viewmodel FoV implemented. Something like a slider or console command for adjustment. 

I just want to see my vascular forearms and beautiful gun model, okay?

94,EtherMining,"All,

Just wanted to point out something I think is important so nobody gets caught with their pants down in 1-2 years (I think far more realistic timeline for POS ETH). First off all I think Raven and quite a few other coins will still be very profitable after POS. So do alot of pro miners out there. However, this definitely will have an impact of course if you pay high electricity. I am in TN so top 5-6 best states for mining. 

Anyways my point here is hobby, money, revenue, bill payer whatever your rig is to you. Make sure to pay attention to the world around you and treat it like a business. Especially if your rig is clean, correctly built, and professional grade and not using zip ties to hold it up. 

TREAT it like a business for example flipping a GPU rig for x2 or x1.5 profit to buy a newer ASIC miner that will obviously mine BTC efficiently for 2-3 years is worth it. BTC mining will get harder, but ASICs will keep up to an extent and yes cost out the a$$. Just don't sit by and not pay attention to the overall stock market, cypto market and changes coming up. The profit on mining will probably never die. HOW you obtain that profit may change and is changing. That is what you need to keep your focus on.

I am the opposite here, newer to mining but have extensive business ownership, Tableau Developer, back end programming and project management experience and crypto mining rigs is no different than buying an selling just about anything else except the obvious technology exponential curve. Let's just say I have made some pretty crazy profits and most of which are not directly mining however, I use mining as a revenue / business income generator to reinvest into other side business that is related. I think mining is a great way to pump out some profits to pay off debts or reinvest into larger project.",0,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=1835, result=""All,\n\nJust wanted to point out something I think is important so nobody gets caught with their pants down in 1-2 years (I think far more realistic timeline for POS ETH).

I agree his stories were created for messages. Misspellings used to suggest (*point to*) other meanings &amp; especially songs i.e. *Hit Parade* \-- &amp; Spanish translations.

This Fenn drawing introduces many message possibilities to consider:

* Do you not think the stick man standing on the milking stool tells something?
* Elvis standing on a 3-legged milking stool holding 2 bells . . . 
* 2 Bells in Navy: regulation of duty watches | Watch i.e. time i.e. clock face | clock time 5:55/17:55 laid out w/ timbers in Arabic &amp; Roman numerals to frame NS the tired mark at broken pi
* *Coherent* Breathing's **Iconic** *2 Bells --* breathing exercises music available at various counts per minute &amp; apparently a cell ring-tone | Meditation 
* *Iconic* like Elvis (the king), faith icons, (standing on) 3-legged stool; Trinity &amp; song: *Standing on the Promises of . . .*his faith, Fenn's *Santa Fe* 
* How about the bells he holds in his hands? Like the bells Fenn sculpted, a frog w/ crooked leg? Like image of a cat's mouth that is actually a bell?
* What about the reference to sun which is our own *star* \-- or perhaps a misspelling of SON -- which could be reference to both his faith &amp; to himself, or perhaps an infant death?
* What about Fenn being knocked off his milking stool by the knotted tail of the cow perhaps representing his faith as a kid? Wayward years?

Hello Everyone,

I recently joined as a member of the board for the HOA in my community. After looking at our documentation and meeting with other members of the board, it is obvious that we are being mismanaged by our contracted Management Property.

Vendors are coming back and complaining that they haven't been paid (or made months later) and are canceling their contracts with us.

Even more concerning we are noticing that this company is moving funds out of our reserve accounts. So far we have noticed that there was an overdraw of 6,752 dollars and another for \~1,100. This is a lot of money (and there are other examples) . It has been about a month since we surfaced these issues with no resolution.

What can we do to hold them accountable for their transactions? (We are in Colorado)

I've thought of reporting them to the better business bureau but is there anything else? We are thinking of starting the process for an audit but it will take quite a bit of funds to get the process started.

Edit: removed some errors and this is cross posted on r/legaladvice",0,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=1077, result="" \n\nHello Everyone,\n\nI recently joined as a member of the board for the HOA in my community.

Hello! As the title suggests, I am looking to roleplay in a fantasy world where you play a shortstack. Whether you play as a goblin, dwarf, halfling, imp, or even a kobald, any small race is welcome.

This can play out either as a normal roleplay or as an adventure that we undergo together, building a relationship as it progresses.

Please try to come with an idea in mind but if not then I can provide some of my own.

My kinks include rough sex, excessive cum, cum play, sloppy sex, teasing, incest, casual sex and nudity, risky sex, and public sex. My hard limits are rape, scat, blood, gore, and cheating/cuckold.

Since then I have found full time work and my claim was closed, I’m new through covid to universal credit so wasn’t really aware of all the procedures and thought that was it, I spoke to UC today no one was really able to help much but told me to open a new claim and explain on the journal my situation and wait for a case manager to contact me.

150,MechanicAdvice,"Hi!

My Citroen DS3 started feeling slow a few days ago, struggling to maintain speed or accelerate. The turbo is whining quite loudly, but I've only had it a few months and it was always a bit whiny. Like a dumbass I assumed it was a normal sound for this car, but maybe not, eh!

Now I assume the turbo is dead or dying. But what are my chances that the rest of the engine is okay? Naturally, I'm not running it for now, but on Thursday I've got to limp it to a nearby garage on tickover without letting the turbo spool up.

So as the turbo is still spinning if I rev the engine, I guess it hasn't seized. Might the engine be otherwise okay?

Car is a 1.6 thp petrol engine, 36000 miles, 2014 Citroen DS3. Same engine as mini cooper and (I think) Peugeot 208gti.

Abstract: The Russian Federation is often portrayed in Western depictions as an overly assertive and unpredictable world power. A look at Russia’s engagement in the Arctic, underpinned by increased military activity, justifies this portrayal even more so. With President Putin’s hold on power secured, a new Arctic strategy in place, and chairmanship of the Arctic Council, Russia is well placed to assert itself as an Arctic power and secure sole supremacy. As sea ice melts, the region’s geopolitical significance solidifies. Due to the vast economic potential, competition among stakeholders has intensified. Climate change has emerged as a key driver of development. The EU is in the process of updating its Arctic strategy.

A look at Russia’s engagement in the Arctic, underpinned by increased military activity, justifies this portrayal even more so. With President Putin’s hold on power secured, a new Arctic strategy in place, and chairmanship of the Arctic Council, Russia is well placed to assert itself as an Arctic power and secure sole supremacy. As sea ice melts, the region’s geopolitical significance solidifies. Due to the vast economic potential, competition among stakeholders has intensified. Climate change has emerged as a key driver of development. The EU is in the process of updating its Arctic strategy. This presents an opportunity to seek practical cooperation about pressing issues such as security, sustainable resource exploitation, trade, as well as the impacts of climate change. This research article addresses the Arctic as an emerging geopolitical hotspot, elaborating on climate change as a major risk.

157,MoneroMining,"Hi guys,

hope you are doing well.
As a hobby miner, who does it to support this wonderful network, I am always looking for decentralization, because (in my eyes): Decentralization = freedom; Centralization = slavery (at least in the most cases.)

So I am looking at the Hashrate Pie chart of Monero and I am thinking:

What if the (i.e.) US government take over ""minexmr"" pool (33%) and ""supportxmr"" pool (18%) at the same time?

Aren't they easily able to do a 51% attack (33 + 18 = 51 (%))?

Currently mining on 2miners - will switch to P2pool once my payout treshhold is reached.

What are your thoughts about that?
Am I missing anything out in my theory of a potencial and ""easy"" XMR network attack?

I am really looking forward to your thoughts!

Long story short, propably have mortons neuroma or some nerve compression in 3rd/4th webspace. The only thing that alleviates it is toe spacers. That neuroma is 3 years ood and pretty painful sharp when i step on it without toe spacers.

I recently developed some sort of pain alongside of my foot too (below pinky toe). Its kind of tight from 3rd,4th and 5th toe and when i walk a little more, that area starts getting weak and unable to bear weight that much.

Furthermore, i hear a little click in two places: on head of my pinky toe and right where tailors bunion (below pinky toe) accompanied with sharp but the same as my original neuroma and then i get some tingling sensation, tightness and weakness. This happens when i bear weight. 

Its kinda annoying cause i figured out that toe spacers is solid solution for my neuroma and even though it isnt pinching, there are these other symptoms which make it difficult to walk... mostly where the tailors bunion location is.",0,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=984, result='Hello,\n\nLong story short, propably have mortons neuroma or some nerve compression in 3rd/4th webspace.

I get what happened and how shit played out. But words are just words right? Why don't we believe the good ones why do we just believe the bad the ones. Just words right?? Because people choose too reach for hate before love. I had chosen to reach for hate most of my life before love until you showed me something better. 

We can't live in hate, no matter what the world is like. We can't focus on all the shit in the world. Create our world, leave the ugly out. Yeah the world's a fucked up place but there is beauty in it as well. Don't let stupid words or this world break that beautiful spirit you have, dig deep for it. Don't lose hope, you're better than that. That's what you taught me, you showed me hope, love, patience, and much more. Showed me I was better than my ugly side, that I had greatness and beauty in me. And I've always seen that in you! 

So why break now? Why give up now on being a kind, beautiful, amazing person? Yes we hurt each other shit happens. We can either believe to see the good in people or the bad? We can rise above the bad now and see the great in everything? Nothing wrong with two people going through hell together to find a beautiful thing. There is always a storm before the calm. Maybe couples who go through hell find something stronger, more real and honest than those who don't.
Worlds not perfect, neither is any relationship they take work. I was damaged I know, and no you don't owe me anything. But you did give me my heart back, my life back. Let that be your guide to keep your beauty with in yourself maybe? Your call just making an observation. 

I know you don't want to be here I respect that. I did hurt your heart a lot, I majorly fucked up. I won't push, just know though I feel the direction you're might be going in, that dark path will only bring you pain and suffering. All I knew was darkness until I met you, I didn't realize what it was like to be so open and free of anguish and pain, and to see the world as a better place even amongst the bad. You have no clue what you showed me and helped me through do you? I hope you do. I wish I could have ripped my bleeding heart from chest to show you my heart before we met, the darkness in it I had no idea was there until your true love pulled it out. 

Just my honest opinion on what I'm seeing. If I'm wrong my apologies, not meaning any harm by it. But I don't feel I'm not far off. You didn't give up on me for almost two years with everything we went through. Think about that. 

In no way am I trying to hurt you, or start a fight or push or talk all day. Just care for you, even as just one human to another. 

P.S My deepest apologies for never truely hearing what you were trying to tell me in our relationship. How you were trying to just make me happy and love life more and to let go of the pain, your support was amazing. I appreciate you.

220,Vermintide,"I am curious to here you guys' experiences woth playing alongside sister of thorns.

My friends and I tend to play together, and one of them plays sister of thorn. I think my biggest gripe is how her abilities can be annoying if not played right in my own point of view.

I admit I love playing all melee classes, so this was primarily slayer and now currebtly the warrior priest (love him so much). And i wonder if maybe these two classes dont mesh well. Full disclosure: Im fully open to consider maybe I or we arent playing our classes right

With SoT her abilities are theoreticalky cool and strategic, very CC. Block chokepoints with bush, cc annoying enemies with hover. But i find what actually happens is Ill be gloriously hacking away at sigmars enemies when suddenly bush in my face! Sure i can go through and it doesnt affect my movement but it can be very disorienting
 
The cc makes enemies hover and disables them, but that also means I have to waddle over to that location to be able to get some damage in

Have you guys faced issues too? Or am i playing in a microcosm? What have been your solutions. Im very interested to hear ways we can work arounf this, pointers for myself, and even discussuing with my friend coordination strategies.

For example, my thibking was suggesting to my friend to make sure hes not bushing a location where heroes are physically at. And also to use the hover ability when our team is swamped rather than target any elite on sight.

Sure we can both play different charactera, but we're both having so much fun woth our respective heroes ot just seems childish to take away a hero he loves loves loves playing, and at the same time id be pretty bummed to have to play something else as a workaround.

221,Warframe,"# Optiframe

Hi, I'm a pretty new computer science major and I've been working on an automated build optimizer for Warframe for the better part of the last month. Also, big wall of text incoming, so **TL;DR: I've made a build optimizer for weapons in Warframe (still in beta though) and it's free to use right now at [optifra.me](https://optifra.me/)!**

## The project

In case anybody cares about the nitty gritty of the project, it's a full-stack web application that uses my own damage calculator and a genetic algorithm with specific evolutionary strategies to optimize the weapon builds by simulating the damage against the resistances of the faction and applying status effects/DoT. I'm thinking about porting it over to a native application to be available on Mobile/Desktop at some point in the future though, but I'd like to hear if that's something that anybody would even want before I actually get started with that idea.

## Features

It currently features the build optimizer that I've been making/polishing over the last 3-4 weeks. The build optimizer takes a weapon you'd like to have a build for and a faction you'll be fighting, then runs thousands of simulations to find the optimal build for that combination. It is currently in a beta-like state though, as things aren't entirely where I'd like them to be in order to call the project complete, but it's in a state that is completely usable for the most part and for the vast majority of players for Warframe. Eventually I'm going to incorporate a Riven build optimizer as well, though that's going to potentially be locked behind a modest (like $5/month) Patreon subscription as I'm going to need help keeping the site afloat because of the whole ""Broke Uni Kid'' situation. The Riven build optimizer nor the standard build optimizer do not give DPS figures purely for the fear of destroying the Riven trade market. I don't want to mess with those traders or DE, frankly because the traders are scary and I've heard of what they do when they get word of someone messing with their market lol. The Riven optimizer is functional as it stands in the back-end, though it isn't implemented on the front-end yet. It's going to either tell you that your Riven roll is bad and that you should either re-roll it or use the baseline build that I'll provide, or if the Riven scores above baseline, it'll give you a build that's optimized for your Riven. Hopefully that's good enough for the community to have a tool where they can have easy optimization of their weapons in Warframe, without having to delve through the wiki to try and figure out how to optimize their weapons, and as a result can just have fun in Warframe.

## Why faction specific?

I know there's a general stigma about people wanting to be lazy and not swap builds around for the different factions, but from my experience it makes the game more enjoyable to just completely destroy the enemy by overkilling them. The easy way of doing that is by optimizing on a per-faction basis. If you should want to just ignore factions though, usually the infested builds are pretty good general builds that you can use instead. It might take some time to get used to swapping builds up, but you have 3 free slots per weapon, so you might as well use them imo. :)

## Privacy/Cookies/Data

I personally am not using any data/cookies for tracking anybody with any specificity, and they should be all anonymized from Firebase/Google's side as well. I'm using Firebase/Google to track the health of the site so that I know if it goes down for some reason, and can hopefully fix it quickly as a result. I'm quite new to web development though (and actually start taking my first course in web development next term as well), so if there are any pros here from the software dev/lawyer professions that can inform me as to what I'm supposed to disclose here, that'd be much appreciated. I put a blanket Privacy Policy that I found via reddit (I know it probably isn't that good) but hopefully it works for now. It says that I use google ads, which I don't at the moment, but I might need to in the future to help pay for the server costs.

## Known problems

Currently the optimizer is still in a beta-state. The builds are not always the absolute optimal build for the weapon, and I'm trying my best to improve it each day. Currently melee weapons are probably it's weakest point, though Sniper Rifle's might also be a bit odd for the builds that get generated. I've tried my best to improve it as much as I can so I can release it pre-New War so people have time to get ready for the new update with it. The thing to note is that it's heavily single-target focused at the moment. I plan on incorporating advanced options to include priorities for stats like punch-through or range, but those aren't available at the moment. Also, Kuva/Tenet progenitor bonuses are NOT factored in at the moment so keep that in mind if you try those builds.

## How to get in touch with me

I have a discord, which you can access [here](https://discord.gg/ameYpjq9), and I'll be sitting in the comments all day as well to answer any questions about my site. If anything breaks, please let me know and I'll try my best to fix it. Hopefully the reddit hug of death doesn't kill my site. :/ This is my first software release though, so there are probably quite a few bugs that I haven't found yet, and it's probably inaccurate to some degree but I've had a lot of fun with the builds that it's generated for me and I hope you all can as well. Some builds may seem odd, but in my testing they've actually proven to be better than pretty much any alternative, which was super fun to find.

Lo que encontré me impresionó mucho: al menos a principios del 2000, clonazepam, al que se le llama Klonopin en Estados Unidos, lleva la marca Ravotril en Chile.

1. Using moonlight, I didn't realize I was local streaming this whole time, I assumed it went over the internet even though I'm in my own house, but I guess within my own house I've been local streaming using my 1gb Ethernet right (or 866mbps wifi)? The only way to stream online is installing that separate app?

2.  If the max bitrate is 150mbps, does that mean that's the most data that's transmitted at any given time? So 4k 120hz would technically look worse then 60hz as it's cramming more into 150mbps? Or am I not understanding right

EverGain is a Hyper-Deflationary Token with Integrated Rebase and Instant BUSD Rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

\# BUSD Rewards 💸

With every transaction there’s a tax associated with it. 7% is taxed for the purpose of our BUSD rewards system. Unlike other coins the holders will get their rewards instantly and automatically, with no need for claiming or waiting.

&amp;#x200B;

\# Anti-Price Manipulation ❌

Our anti-price manipulation system includes: Anti-Whale, Anti-Dump, Anti-Bot, Anti-Rugpull, Anti-Spam and Sell-Multiplier. This ensures security for all holders by stopping excessively large buys and sells that aim to manipulate the price in favour of whales and bots. Every transaction can only be made fairly for all parties involved.

&amp;#x200B;

\# Rebase 📈

Rebase is an effective burn strategy where we can reduce the supply of the token to increase the price. This allows us to create a healthy, EverGaining chart which attracts new investors allowing us to reach bigger milestones in the future.

279,dirtypenpals,"Damn, being lonely fucking sucks. You'd think living in a big city would allow for countless opportunities to make friends, form relationships and live a full life. Alas no, it's even more lonely than the small town I grew up in. Here I am, apartment to myself, no friends to go out with, no girlfriend to share my time with, nothing to do at all. I fill my time shopping mainly. The kitch stores around here always have something mildly interesting worth a look at. A record here, a painting there, a weird occult looking book perchance.

It's that very occult book I picked up that begins this tale. Absent mindedly flicking through it:s pages one night after one too many glasses of wine, I stumble on an incantation which should grant me ""the companion of your dreams."" Of course, it's just a stuffy old book isn't it? It'll never work. I say it aloud, partly in amusement but with a hint of desperation, and suddenly the room is engulfed in black smoke and red light. Once it fades, there you are...

It's about time I moved onto a different sort of demon from my usual vampire idea. I'd like to play a spin on the usual ""I've summoned a demon and she's hot but oh no she's going to peg me and call me a little piggy"" ideas I see often. What if love to play is a rather slice of life esque prompt where you're a gorgeous succubus and I'm a nerdy loner, but instead of dominating me and turning me into a footstool, it turns out we have chemistry and we actually form a cute as fuck relationship. I prefer my RP's light hearted and funny, and that definitely extends to this. There doesn't have to be anything deep with this RP, just be as silly as you like.


My character is, as mentioned, a 26 year old, rather lonely need type. He's 5ft 10, nicely built but not gym ripped with natural pecs, wide shoulders, the start of abs slowly being buried under a bit of a dad bod, thick, strong legs and a nice butt that honestly puts some women to shame. Really, he's the stereotypical nerd who got hot but doesn't know it yet.

As for your character, I'm absolutely happy for you to put forth who you like. I do have a type, that being goths, however it's not a requirement.

As for my kinks, I am a true switch, happy as either dominant, submissive or more vanilla, which gives us the opportunity to take this in a couple of different directions. The ones I have in mind are a completely vanilla relationship, me surprisingly taking charge because I find dominating a typically dominant demon brings out my confidence, or you mommy dommeing the ever loving fuck out of me.

Kinks: Women in Lingerie, stockings, thigh high socks and generally sexy clothing. Sex and outercourse in said clothing. Baby Oil. Spit and cum play. Spanking. Begging. Teasing. Dirty talk with a little hint of degradation but nothing extreme. A bit of rough play like light choking and light restraint.

Limits: anything illegal, dangerous, very painful, or unsanitary.

2)Road trip. We’re on a trip with friends or family. There is a very limited amount of room in the car because the car we were going to use broke down. You’re forced to sit on my lap in the trip for a few hours.

  
3)Our groups cumhole. We’re not bad guys. We’re not really good guys either. We saw a cute shy girl who was lonely in college and decided to invite her into our group. But we had a hidden agenda. The only reason we wanted to be friends is so we could pass you around like our personal cumhole.

I'm going to be buying a 2nd kit very soon - woo! 

I currently own a Mapex Meridian Birch kit which is quite big and boomy, and has served me brilliantly for hard hitting, bigger band projects. However I've started playing on some gigs which require a more subtle touch, sometimes a bit jazzy/acoustic. 

I'm 99% certain I'm going to buy a Gretcsh Catalina. It's got the right drum sizes I want, plus they're affordable and other drummers have recommended them highly. 

However I'm a bit clueless on snare drums. Not sure what brand, material or style would suit a a softer touch.

Can I trouble you all for some advice? Would love to hear your opinions on different snares you've played or owned (also if any of you have experience with a Catalina please share!)

About 2 years ago my parents split up and got a divorce after almost 25 years of a messy marriage. My dad is a narcissistic drug abuser and I was never really close to my mom growing up because she always felt the need to protect my brother (who got most of the physical abuse from my father). I was just kind of ignored and expected to be okay even though I was hurting so much on the inside. 

Now I’m 21 years old and this mess has been going on since I was about 8 years old. My mom got engaged a year ago after only knowing the guy for a month. I’ve come around to the idea of her getting married and I actually really like the guy. I’m just happy that he makes her happy and treats her well after everything my dad put her through. 

My dad got engaged to a woman recently that he’s only known for a month. He’s getting married to her in February and my mom is getting married in January. My dad doesn’t really talk to me and when he does he puts on this fake act like we’re best friends. He didn’t talk to my brother for almost 2 years and then asked him to be his best man. Seeing my dad get engaged has just brought a lot of emotions up in me. Ive seen pictures of him with this little girl in his fiance’s family and I just wish he could’ve been that person for me. Also, this lady has no idea what she just got herself into and I know for a fact my dad hasn’t changed. 

I had a conversation a couple weeks ago with him about everything and how his actions effected me to see if he had really changed. He just kept blaming it all on my mom and her family even for the drug addiction. I guess I’m just reaching out to Reddit to see how to deal with this situation and advice from people who have maybe gone through similar things.",0,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=1740, result='\nAbout 2 years ago my parents split up and got a divorce after almost 25 years of a messy marriage.

Plot: It's Christmas time and for the first time in a few years the Futa aunt will finally be visiting the family, she used to Come over every holiday but with her new job and moving to a different state she hadn't been able to visit for 5 years. But now with finally some free time she's coming to visit 

I do have a more detailed explanation on the pairs relationship with each other and how it will played out, sooo if your interested do send me a dm cutiess, ah also I'm mainly looking to roleplay on either Kik, Discord,twitter ~~~And for my kinks and limits 
Kinks:DDlg, Orgasm denial (giving), creampies,public play,romance,after care,risky play, multiple rounds, smegma,musk,incest,cuddling, hair pulling, rough sex,spanking, steamy sex,size difference,age difference

Loncor Gold Inc. is a Canadian gold exploration company focused on projects on the Ngayu Belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The adumbi gold deposit is the current focus of Loncor’s activity and can be found within Loncor’s 84.68% owned Imbo Project.

The company is looking to further expand its current portfolio and resources of super exciting exploration targets on the Ngayu Belt.

Adumbi has a resource Loncor believes could soon approach 5 million ounces, with 3.66 million ounces within the pit shell and further underground resources being drilled at depth. The relatively high grade remains one of their highlighted positives, with the early stage indications suggesting the deposit holds the potential of cash costs similar to the nearby Barrick managed Kibali mine- an operation that had ASIC costs per ounce of US$778/oz in 2020, which was the lowest ASIC costs of any of the six Barrick’s African mines.

The resource remains open at depth below 550 metres

* Loncors team has previously delineated 17 million ounces of gold resources in areas of similar geology in neighbouring countries, plus 13 million ounces of gold resources in the 15 years of operating in the DRC, with Ngayu Bel being the number one focus now.
* Loncor holds exploration permits covering an area of 3,534 km2 of the Ngayu Archean greenstone belt in the northeast DRC.
* Africa’s largest gold mine, the Barrick managed Kibali Gold mine, is only 130 miles away.
* The company argurably offers the largest direct deposit exposure to the gold potential of the North East DRC.
* The team is looking to assess the potential of Adumbi through an imminent resource upgrade followed by a preliminary economic assessment in the second half of 2021.
* On June 10th, 2020, a NI 43-101 technical report on the Imbo Project was filed on SEDAR and confirmed the inferred resource increase, which was prepared by Minecon Resources and Services Limited with an effective date of April 17, 2020.

With Loncor controlling a gold resource of 2.50 million ounces and their Imbo Project containing 1.88 million ounces of indicated gold resources, they are looking very promising to make big steps in the gold industry. The company also has numerous other targets to explore with both being very close to Adumbi and further afield.

I didn't downvote you. (Though I imagine the reasoning of ""that's not the Thing That Makes JW Different"" (because it's a pretty strict belief system) might be *why* downvotes might have happened?)

~~The two different comments about `Jehovah's Witnesses` had me down a Caleb and Sophia reviews by `disfellowshipped` guy rabbithole again though...~~

I didn't  know `Jehovah's Witnesses`  had negative views on gay people and magic or birthdays. I only knew they don't celebrate holidays. In SU the there's no Halloween, Easter, or Christmas  celebrations (No Chanukah, Passover, or Rosh Hashanah/Yom Kippur either). I learned on a different sub that the JW don't do these holidays. Anyway it's no reason for someone  here to downvote me into the negatives (like you idiots don't have better things to do)

&gt; I think in the SU universe the majority of people are `Jehovah's witnesses`.

Unlikely since no one appears to have a problem with gay people, birthday parties, New Year's celebrations, and actions by the gems often called ""magic"" unless property damage is occurring.

Its implied the main religion is `Jehovahs witness`, a branch of Christianity.

Unlikely they're `Jehovah's Witnesses` considering all the things that are very okay in SU's 'verse which would very much not be considered okay by `Jehovah's Witnesses`.

I think in the SU universe the majority of people are `Jehovah's witnesses`. That explains the lack of holiday celebrations. It also means religion still exists just  not in the way we know it. Or maybe culture exists without religion?

Hi All, will try and make this short and to the point. 

I am currently in a custody case with my ex, Today (12/13/21) we had Trial but it was put on continuance because my ex let another man sign the birth certificate without proof of paternity so now he has to be present in court to sign a Denial. On top of that I have been hounding her and my attorney to get a DOP and AOP handled since February of this year, and her lawyer lied today in court and said she was only aware of the AOP as of some time last week, which is a bunch of BS.

I met my ex in May of 2019, was supposed to be a summer fling but ended up getting her pregnant June of that year. From the get go she was giving me the run around, telling me I was the father, but then running away with this ex who coincidently looks almost similar to me. She has non stop lied since the day I met her, she told me said Ex was unable to have children, which explains why she used me for a child, we were on and off again until this child was born in April of 2020, I was never allowed to know about the pregnancy, I was kept under the radar until May of 2020, I came home from a friends house and she is shacked up in the spare room with the child, Mind you I live with my parents and they allowed her to move in when the ex found out he wasn't the child. I ended up getting a DNA test and the child is mine, 99.999999%. 

We were together for about 8 months before she walked out on me with out child on Christmas Day 2020. Its been a non stop fight since the day she left. 

So is there a way I Can take her to court and sue for Emotional Damages? I got a vasectomy because of how traumatized I was from the situation that I do not want to go thru that again, Ive been put on anxiety medications because of her, and now I am at my wits end and honestly, some days it feels it would be easier to just sign my rights away so she could have the family she always dreamed of with the Ex that signed the Birth Certificate.

340,mentalillness,"I don't know if this is the right place to talk about this kind of stuff, but I have no one to talk to in real life nor ways to cope in a significant way. I've been struggling with depression since I was a teenager and my living conditions have made it a bit harder in the last few weeks.

I gave up my job and most of my belongings and moved to a Nordic country. I've been here for about two weeks, I don't know the language and the culture. I'm supposed to start working soon, but in the meantime I'm stuck in a vicious cycle of trying to be disciplined and take care of myself.

Right off the bat, my sleeping schedule got obliterated. I wake up in the afternoon and I fall asleep in the early hours of the morning, so I haven't seen any daylight in a while. It's extremely cold outside, but very hot in the house, and the air is really dry, which has a big impact on my mood and energy.

I'm on a tight budget until January, and this is spiraling my eating issues into oblivion. I don't like eating to begin with, and on top of that, I feel like I have to do a significant activity to deserve the one meal/day I allow myself to have. This is probably a combination of childhood trauma, living in semi poverty as a young adult and depression. I'm used to it, but combined with everything else that has been going on, it feels worse than ever.

I feel weak both physically and mentally and it gets worse every day.
I live with a friend who doesn't understand these types of struggles and opening up just drains me even more.

I hope to feel better once I start working. I moved away from home to experience something new, get a decent amount of money and improve my life. I have a family back home that I am constantly worried about and if improve myself I could make their life a bit better too.

Put a trap out yesterday and still nothing. Didn’t find any poop or anything weird while cleaning. There’s really no way that they could get into my room, it’s a pretty small and empty room. So I was thinking that they might be coming from somewhere else in the house. I’m also upstairs. \n\nI’m 17 been living in this home for 5 years and we’ve never found more than the random rat or possum like twice ever. But now I’m worried cause of the viruses. Is there anything else I can do to clean to prevent any viruses until I can figure out where this is coming from?

Agonism of the D1 will ultimately strengthen hippocampal CA1 strength, with the circuit ultimately increasing stimulation to the dorsal raphe in the brainstem.

I keep looking for ways to improve it but I guess it makes sense that other than circuit level stimulation this is about as good as it's going to get for non-invasive stimulation.

Rey is a Mary Sue of a character that spent all her lifetime on some desert planet selling hunks of junk and then she's able to pilot the millennium falcon as soon as she saw the controls (something that Luke, who by lore had past experience with starcraft, wasn't able to do at all as shown in the first film). then you have Kylo Ren who is just a Darth Vader cosplayer, doesn't even have a good lightsaber and is literally beaten by someone who never used a lightsaber before (albeit that's entirely because Rey is a Mary Sue. realistically Kylo Ren by that point should have atleast mastered a couple forms of lightsaber combat while Rey wouldn't've been able to hold it properly).

the last jedi is the 2nd worst movie in the sequel trilogy (worst being rise of skywalker). take knights of ren, Snoke, Luke Skywalker, practically everything that was set up in the original + prequel trilogies and throw it in a blender, then throw that into the trash cause none of it is used. you need years of training to fight with a lightsaber, nah fuck that Rey straight up masters a form of lightsaber combat in a week or so then off to fight Kylo Ren and Snoke's dudes (who are the worst royal guard in any film). literally a piece of bull movie all around, Po and Finn are thrown into the trash.

the rise of skywalker is the worst thing in existence. the biggest issue with it is the lack of lore coherency. palpatine dies then puts himself into a clone. that premise by itself is a complete deservice to Anakin Skywalker and the entire story arc that the original trilogy and prequels created.

* Lots of white, pink, and orange light in the beginning 
* Angel wings visible a few times 
* I saw a planet that looked very similar to Saturn but I couldn't tell if it actually was Saturn or not. 
* What appeared to be a few light beings coming towards me. I couldn't see their faces, they just glowed so brightly kind of a golden-white. 
* I saw something that looked like one of the Egyptian pyramids. 
* I saw Part of a woman's face... it was so beautiful and peaceful. Pale, porcelain-like skin. 
* A **large round glowing thing**. It was violet-indigo color and had waves of energy coming off of it. 
* I saw a **golden diamond shape outline** that was radiating gold and white energy or light. 

... I did a starseed report on Etsy. Here's what I found out! 

My origin is a planet quite far from Earth, not visible to the naked eye... somewhere **behind the Big Dipper**. It is a bit smaller than Earth. but similar climates and nature. It has a **lot of pyramids**. Tall humanoid beings with silvery blonde hair, long faces, and big heads to accommodate large brains. It has advanced space exploration programs. Crystals are very important there, especially the **red crystals**. I mastered the art of working with crystals while there and gained a lot of high insights into the cosmos. Now I just need to figure out how to tap into all that insight. 

I also have connections to:

* **Polaris**
* **Spica** \- I was an **angelic being**
* **Pleiades** \- especially **Taygeta**
* **Andromeda**
* **α-Centauri**
* **Alsciaukat, Lynx constellation** \- both races but multiples lives as the **fairy race**

Another person told me:  ""I'm not allowed to give it away because you are on your own path and must go through your own process and you are DEFINITELY headed in the right direction. When meditating ask for **Queen Avlania of the Pure Light**.  I AM allowed to tell you that amongst other races ( you've been pretty much ALL of them ) you are....and this one is THE most important for you..... **HYADEAN from Avabailu in the π star system**...

You're on the right path love.... **Arcturian** too is very important for you...it's why you're so analytical."" 

So, **does anyone have any insight into what planet this could be behind the Big Dipper?**

Also, any info on Queen Avlania of the Pure Light, HYADEAN from **Avabailu** in the π star system, and the Fairy race of Alsciaukat, Lynx constellation? And do **red crystals** mean anything to anyone?

390,stepparents," Hi All,

I'm new to this subreddit and I suppose like most of you, I'm looking for support and advice. A little background: I have no kids, and my soon-to-be wife has a child from a previous relationship, who I have known since she was about to turn 5 and love dearly. Sorry in advance for bragging, but she is currently 7 (going on 25), highly intelligent and sweet. She is also as stubborn as her mom (and that's saying a lot) lol. We have her full time since the dad is currently not really in the picture, aside from a stray visit once every couple months, or when he remembers he has a kid. It has become very confusing for her, especially because since our engagement she has been calling me 'dad' more and more. Though she still uses my first name more often than not, likely from rote repetition.

Generally speaking, has anyone been in a similar situation? What sort of challenges can you foresee moving forward? One issue I'm currently wrestling with is that for years I have been the 'fun' person, and it will be more and more important to transition into an authority/a more traditional parent role. Any advice on best ways to make that transition smoother? I don't want my partner to be the only disciplinarian, but I always worry that the relationship with me and my SD could crumble at any minute.

To add a bit more complexity to this situation, we recently found out that we are expecting a daughter next summer. The last thing I want is for my SD to feel left out, or not a part of our family. Aside from making time for just her and I (before and after the baby is born), any tips or suggestions?",0,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=1615, result="" Hi All,\n\nI'm new to this subreddit and I suppose like most of you, I'm looking for support and advice.

391,suggestmeabook,"Hey guys

I’m looking to get a gift for a friend and it’s quite difficult because his depression doesn’t really allow him to maintain hobbies outside of gaming and I would like to avoid just getting him a steam card

In short: this is the type of book I’m looking for

I want to get him a book that could either focus on some interesting philosophy. Something he likely hasn’t read as a student but would be relevant to his learning. He doesn’t mine if he doesn’t agree with the stance :). Though I’d prefer the book didn’t feel like homework and was more fun to read. I don’t know if fiction philosophy exists but if it does that would be gas (like Neon Genesis Evangelion or Devilman or Akira)

Alternatively. A fun and easy read book that might relate to his situation and how things not going his way is temporary

Below is some info about him

He’s a pretty solid academic. He’s passionate about his philosophy courses despite being constantly shut down by classmates (he’s not even an asshole he just tends to do exactly what the professors tell them to do and question everything lmfao). While he’s not the most avid of readers he will read when he gets the chance to

He loves Harry Potter and Legend of Zelda

Recently his family made some choices that were clearly inconsiderate of his feelings. As I mentioned he’s a heavy gamer. But they bought a new house in an even more remote area than he last lived. They have minimal internet so he can’t play online at all. All of his friends are at least an hour away or more. All of whom work or are students so meeting online is difficult and meeting in person is even harder. Then his family started rummaging through his stuff and assuming stuff that wasn’t garbage WAS garbage. It’s nothing world breaking and he’s doing his best to stay positive but you can tell he’s hurt in how they made all these decisions to benefit his older sibling while not even thinking about how that affects him who’s still in school and job seeking.

432,ubisoft,"I'm an old gamer (50), and I love playing games. I played every major game/franchise that come out in the last 20 years. I bought watchdogs last year, played an hour or two, and left it. Didn't understand what it is and what's actually inside the game. Last week, out of boredom, I started to play again. Oh boy. In my opinion, it's the best watchdog of all three, and it's better than GTA5. Let me explain.

Immersion-city is fantastic, NPC design/behavior/reactions are really astonishing.

Atmosphere-This is truly cyberpunk, much more than a cyberpunk 2077, music, rain, weather with storms...

Story-It's a good story, not the best, but it has a sense of urgency and it motivates you to keep going on which is what the story is supposed to do.

Mission structure- In my 50 years of gaming, I saw every trick and mechanic that industry can pull off. Nothing new here. But it has a great variety and combine with excellent cutscenes it's great.

Side content- Did you know you can play a full game of chess in this game. Man, I don't know any other open game in the market that can have that. The number of different mini-games and little things inside is also great. It's clear that Ubisoft was making his own version of GTA5.

As for the watchdogs2/3, I also played them but not that much. What I didn't like.

Watchdogs 2 is great, but it's like a giant playground. I feel I can play if I want to, but I don't have the need to play it like the first one. There is no motivation because the story and the overall feel are light and comic. Your fight doesn't matter. Or not much. And there is much less side content in terms of collectibles and minigames and other stuff.

Watchdog 3-First, the removed ""change car camera"". It's stupid, why did they do that? I really like that feature in the first two games. Second, you can't play music while you free roam the city-second stupidity, because roaming the city with music is my favorite part. The story is confusing and not motivating at all. Being able to play as anyone is cool, but that's about it. Minigames and side activities are really small and that's what breaks the immersion which for me is most important in the open world. The game looks beautiful, but compared to the previous two games in terms of quality content inside it can't hold the candle.

Anyway, that's just my two cents. Watchdogs (one), hugely, hugely underrated game. Buy it, play it if you didn't, they rarely make games like this these days. All the gaming industry is turned to quick cash grab, watered-down content, repeating the same formula and mechanics, selling unfinished games (patch one will save you).",0,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=2644, result='I\'m an old gamer (50), and I love playing games.

Anyone want to take a guess what it has in common with the Fellowship of the Ring Film adaption?
Virtually everything, there's scene after scene in the film, even little details that aren't actually important to the story pulled directly from the books and into the film.
Tolkeins masterful dialogue makes it directly into the film with very little changes.
I can listen to the audiobook and see the scene from the film in my head with very little ""adjustment"" needed.

 The LotR films are critically acclaimed, incredibly Influential and timeless, they followed the source material very closely.

And yet we have show shills defending the WoT show because it's the exact opposite of the above and is virtually unrecognizable to the books.

Listening to LotRs and remembering how faithful the movies were just makes me even sadder for WoT.
Its what we could have gotten, but no we needed 2 original characters to fridge, World Lore broken entirely and lesbians munching carpet just to start.

It all leaves me feeling thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread.",0,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=1298, result='So I\'ve just started up the audiobook for Fellowship of the Ring and have just finished going through Bilbos 111th birthday party and his confrontation afterward with Gandalf.\n\nAnyone want to take a guess what it has in common with the Fellowship of the Ring Film adaption?\nVirtually everything, there\'s scene after scene in the film, even little details that aren\'t actually important to the story pulled directly from the books and into the film.\nTolkeins masterful dialogue makes it directly into the film with very little changes.\nI can listen to the audiobook and see the scene from the film in my head with very little ""adjustment"" needed.\n\n The LotR films are critically acclaimed, incredibly Influential and timeless, they followed the source material very closely.\n\nAnd yet we have show shills defending the WoT show because it\'s the exact opposite of the above and is virtually unrecognizable to the books.\n\nListening to LotRs and remembering how faithful the movies were just makes me even sadder for WoT.\nIts what we could have gotten, but no we needed 2 original characters to fridge, World Lore broken entirely and lesbians munching carpet just to start.\n\nIt all leaves me feeling thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread.', metadata={'sentence': '0'}, embeddings=[])]",0

Chimps usually live in groups with more adult females than males, but in the group with the murder it was the other way round.

Also the cost of government sponsored sex would be fairly cheap compared to birth control and abortion because we don't need to manufacture anything or perform procedures. It's just sex amirite?

2) They say it's just not for sex reasons. Birth control can help them with hormones, periods, and other health issues. With government sponsored sex, it can help with mental issues, depression, social development and lower incel suicide rate.

3) They say benefits include reducing tax payer burden due to unwanted children not draining resources. For incels, the sex would reduce the amount and cost of us going to professional mental health clinics via health insurance. Also might motivate NEETS to get a job and stop collecting NEET BUX (welfare for normie lurkers). So happier, working, incels would mean a more productive society.

4) Some of us unfortunate incels cannot afford prostitutes thus we cannot have sex in this sexually liberated society. But with government sponsored we can now have sex that some us just can't afford.

5) If taxpayer money goes to something that directly benefits half the population, then some money should goes to something that benefits the other half. Roads, education, and health insurance don't count because it directly helps both genders.

6) Crime reduction. If abortion and birth control reduce this, then government sponsored sex will too. Incels would have lower frustration and mental issues with this and reduce crime rate. Also it would reduce random creepy encounters in public that females hate so much.

Their bullying is overt and it's obvious to everyone that their target is completely innocent.  The school administration is well aware of their antics and they're always getting in trouble.


That's how bullies are in cartoons, movies, TV, etc.  but in real life a lot of bullies are actually very savvy, calculating, manipulative, and charming.  They can appear angelic and innocent to most people and then go and mess with a select few because they can get away with it.  They carefully select their targets, they make sure it's someone most people already dislike which is going to be the ugly weird guy most of the time.  


Here's where the problem come into play.  When the ugly weird guy gets messed with, most people think he deserves it.  Even if people are really conscious about bullying, the bully can just make up some outright lies about their target and convince everyone that their target was the actual bully, and since everyone is more than prepared to hate the ugly male, they'll all believe them.  


Even worse is the fact that if an ugly male fights back **everyone will view him as the bad guy**.


When Chad beats up an ugly male, he's seen as a hero who gave a creep his just desserts.

When an ugly male fights back against a good looking guy and wins, he's seen as a psycho who threw a tantrum.  


When I was in high school and I fought back against good looking guys and won, girls actually hated me MORE and were openly disgusted by me.  So I'm speaking from personal experience here.


Honestly, it's best if the ""bullying"" problem just gets ignored completely.  Let might make right.  Is ""might makes right"" a perfect system?  No.  But it's a shit load better than the current attitude everyone has of bullying and violence being okay if it happens to someone they dislike or don't care about but horrible when it happens to someone they like.  


So instead of looking at it in terms of ""bullies"" and ""victims"" we should look at it in terms of winners and losers.

Hair

Hair, in my opinion, makes or breaks you. For men, with hair you have 2 options. Short hair, or long hair(well you can do medium hair, but it's meh imo)

Short Hair: With short hair, either opt for classy and stylish.(Donald Draper great example) Or you can go for sexy messy hair which you tend to see a lot in movies.

For long hair, honestly, just grow it out. It's hard to go wrong with it. If you have a diamond shaped face you're perfect for long hair.

Another aspect on whether you want to go for short, or long hair is how you want to be viewed as.

Short hair is very masculine. If you've got a good vibe, short hair will make you look like more of a leader, more dominant.

Long hair is very sexual. If you've got a good vibe, long hair will make you appear rebellious and like a very sexual man.

This is why you see leaders and people in the workforce usually have short hair. Long hair signals rebelliousness so not so good for being a leader or following the rules your boss set out for you.

Why don't I like medium hair? Imo, medium length hair is too... safe. You don't get the added masculinty from short hair and you don't get the added sexuality from long hair.
If you're still not sure what to do with your hair. Go to a stylish salon, and tell the stylist to make you look cool and sexy. Then you can just copy that haircut if you like it. Moving on.


Facial Hair
Facial hair is interesting in the sense that depending on your race and where you live(and the women you go for) you might need more or less.

If you're white or asian: Opt for mor facial hair. If you're black: opt for minimal facial hair If you're latin: Go in between. See what works best for you

These are just generalizations. But, black guys are seen as the most dominant race where as white guys are seen as less dominant. So whites can get away with more facial hair whereas a black guy with too much facial hair looks scary and too masculine. Take a look at yourself and how masculine is your vibe and decide.

Light stubble: In a study done, men with light facial hair where deemed most attractive by women. 

Medium stubble: In the same study, they found women rated men with good amount of stubble as the most dominant. 

Beards: They also found that men with beards were seen as the most masculine.

So what's the most important? I'd say stick with either the light or medium stubble. I rock light facial hair cus I have a very pretty face, so it's better for me if I don't hide it under too muc hair.

As for styles:
You can go for the full stubble, with a shaved neck. You can get a chinstrap soulpatch for the douche factor lol. Or you can get a moustache and goatee. These are all great. Ever notice black guys look great with a light moustache and goatee? Cus it's not too much.

Why don't I like no facial hair? Same reason I don't like medium length hair. It's too safe. Men with no facial hair look ""nice"" and lose that degree of edge facial hair provides.

Fashion
Not going to go too much into this. Wear clothing that fits you properly. Your clothes should feel snug against your body. Stop dressing like a damn hoodlum or thug.

Fashion will make or break you. It's really damn important.
Start wearing button down shirts. In general, if you skin is lighter use darker colors and vice versa. Get yourself some designer jeans that look great. You only need 1.

Shoes. Get yourself some damn good shoes. Stop wearing fucking sneakers! Anything classy and formal is fine. I like to wear double monks and chelseas.

Accesories are important too. I recommend either 1 or 2 at most. Get yourself a cool necklace or a cool bracelet or ring or watch. Don't overdo it.

Blazers. Wearing suits will make you look more stylish and put together than simply wearing button downs, but it depends on were you live. If you live somewhere were people already dress nicely, then yeah, opt for it. If people were you live dress like shit then button downs are enough.

You should be aiming to look better than everyone else by a bit, but not too much that you stick out like a sore thumb.

One thing. They did a study that found that the color RED makes you more attractive to women(and men if you're a woman). So get something red.

Walk

Your walk can be very powerful. How should you walk? The best example I've seen told is, you either want to walk like a male model on the catwalk, or like a cowboy gun slinger from the old west. Both powerful, but different.

The general cues are: Shoulder swagger back and forth. Thighs spaced far apart. No hip swaying. Make sure you keep your chin parrallel to the ground and your eyes forward or above the crowd.

This guy's a great example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75aX9mlipiY

Last thing. Don't move out of the way for anybody unless they're disabled. Once you start walking like this,99% of both men and women will move out of the way for you. At the most, take a half step to the side if anyone's trying to challenge you or you're going to crash into someone if you don't move.


Voice:
Voice is another make or break kind of fundamental. A sexy man's voice is powerful and resonant, with slight purring.

Best example? Listen to George Clooney speaking and you'll be golden.
Non-Verbals

Posture: Chest out, shoulders back, chin parralel to the ground(generally).

Eye contact: When sexy men look at people in the eyes, there is no degree of shyness. They know they are looking at you and you know it too. Opt for looking at the bridge between both eyes rather than one eye or the other. This makes your eye contact appear more focused and genuine. When breaking eye contact, always do it to the side, never break eye contact down(this signals submission).

 Don't shift around looking from one eye to the other, Im sure you've seen people do this, and it signals that you're seeking a reaction.

 Lastly, generally, if the other perosn is talking, you want to be looking at them more than they're looking at you but not enough that they are uncomfortable or you're creepily staring. If you're taking, break eye contact more often, and make sure to look away when you say a joke or somethign that could make it look like you're seeking a reaction.

Touch: Sexy men touch women(and men their friends with). Whether you touch her ""incidently"" as in letting your leg rest against hers, or on purpose like touching her arm or elbow when she says something funny. Or more aggressive touch like caressing her face, ass, or pussy. etc.

Touch is really important. It builds comfort and a connection. People who really like each other are always touching each other. Pay attention to it next time.

Physical Proximity: Sexy men get close to the women they're courting. Getting physically close as you're talking to women helps create a deeper connection with her and makes her like you more. 

Ever spoken to someone who was far away from you? After a few minutes I bet things started getting awkward and you didnt really ""feel"" connected to them? It also signals that you're not a guarded, reserved person. It's refreshing for women to have a man be unapologetically sexual and vulnerable.

Quick note. Getting close to women can backfire on you. But it will only backfire on the women who don't like you. They'll think you're a bit creepy. But the women that do like you will absolutely love it.

Stillness and Low Effort: Sexy, powerful men move slow. Look at someone you thought was powerful and notice thier movement. It's always slow and controlled, almost as if they're doing it on purpose.

This one is really fucking important. Start slowing down your movements. Everything from your walk, to your eye contant, to your sentences. Powerful men do things slowly, steady, and unhurried. They take their time and make people wait.

They put in the least amount of effort to get maximum results. Did you catch that? Powerful men get results while appearing effortless. Abide by this rule.

Smile: Oh the smile... so beautiful ;). A study was conducted that found that women rate men who smile as unnactrtactive compared to men with serious faces on. But this doesn't men you shouldn't smile at all.

It depends on how you smile. How do friendly men smile? Big and wide smile with a lot of teeth showing.

But how do sexy men smile? With their mouths closed. Sexy men will smile using half-smiles, smirks, and smiles were you're smiling from one side more than the other.
The difference is the friendly smile shows happniess, which is unnactrative in men.

As for the sexy smile shows you know something the other person doesn't, or that you don't buy what they're selling. It's playful, knowing, and mischievous. That's the big difference.

Example of Ian smiling sexily here: https://www.google.com/search?q=ian+somerhalder+smiling&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR2J-D64rXAhXHYyYKHZslAPEQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1360&amp;bih=662#imgrc=Yf5D25oc8w5KNM:

Notice the slant I spoke about. Very sexy. And yes, I know it's a meme... Best example I could find.

One last thing. When you smile, do it slowly. This shows that it's genuine and not simply a polite, akward smile.

Facial Expressions: How do sexy men look at women?

Again, Ian Somerhalder another great example.

What you'll notice: chin tucked, eyes peaking up/to the side. Lips slightly pursed, and a small, almost undistinguishable smirk.

Just take a look at any James Bond and you'll notice this: https://www.google.com/search?q=daniel+craig+bond&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9k6Xj54rXAhVGeSYKHVCYAqUQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1360&amp;bih=662#imgrc=xhjh-UWoM_ZQvM:

Basically, this is what a 44 year old woman who got 947 matches from guys under the age of 30 says about Tinder:

""When you are a female on Tinder, guys will be creepy and write ""DTF"" as a first line, like this guy. So women get tired of this bull**** and put up ""no hookups"" in their profile to eliminate the creeps.

After you get hundreds of messages like this, they get old and tiresome. 

The only reason to use Tinder is to reach the guys who would never use online dating otherwise. This was how I found a lot of college athletes. Those guys have never been on OKCupid or POF, they see that as desperate. But in college everyone has Tinder, so they are all curious.

&gt;be me

&gt;get job

&gt;think job will suddenly make life better

&gt;use money from job to occasionally buy trinkets to keep the darkness in my life at bay

&gt;think job could actually improve me as a person


&gt;at this job, I meet lots of new people

&gt;at first, I'm understandably paranoid, quiet, and guarded

&gt;during my quiet phase, everyone treats me cautiously, nicely, and almost with deference

&gt;it's almost as if they are afraid that I might be the next ER

&gt;but 99% of these people seem genuinely friendly and nice, so I eventually begin interacting with them more actively

&gt;I start to develop informal, pseudo/quasi-friendships

&gt;I let my guard down gradually

&gt;I soon fall under the delusion that these people will always be nice to me

&gt;start to question my previous cynicism about mankind

&gt;violent thoughts start to wane in intensity

""Wow, I think I might actually settle down and become a happy normie,"" I actually thought. Wow, what a naive 'tard I was becoming.

Whoops, guess what, the demonic entity in control of the universe had a surprise in store for me!

&gt;slowly, the novelty of me being a new employee apparently starts to wear off

&gt;when my work becomes confusing, overwhelming, or extremely complicated, most of the people who used to greet my questions with a smile and an eager offer of assistance now begin to grunt and push me aside condescendingly


Yesterday, I asked my manager, a black female, a question about a situation that I had never encountered before. My job deals with tricky, legalistic matters (monotonous legal shit with a sales component and a liquid shit serving of face-to-face interaction with gutter-dwelling trash customers), and you have to be very careful with the decisions and statements that you make when interacting with clients, lest you be held legally responsible for a fuck-up that could get you fired and blacklisted from the field forever.

I was sincerely in need of help and I had been told during my training that, if I did not know something, it was my fucking responsibility to get the fuck off my ass and ask someone who *does* know.

I sent an instant message using a company-sanctioned messaging app to my manager, whose fucking job it is to help grunts like me when we need help, and she fucking shat on me for ten minutes while I sat face-to-face, stammering nervously and growing ever more embarrassed and red-faced with a fucking client sitting right across from me. (Needless to fucking say, I didn't make the fucking sale.)

I excused myself from the room and walked up to the manager in a different part of the huge fucking office, speed-walking like an autistic retard the whole way there. I was scared, not angry, and I was actually glad to see her when I finally found her. She looked at me with contempt and immediately shot out a rebuke along the lines of, ""I saw your message. You don't need to come over here,"" as if I were the bad guy and as if I were the fucking asshole putting undue pressure on her to help resolve a situation that could cost me my fucking job (my revenue stream for buying stupid shit to keep me sane, a.k.a. the only thing between me and the grave) if I make a mistake.

This was someone who I thought was a ""nice"" person, a supportive person who I would always approach with a smile. I put my trust in someone who shat on me without warning. I usually get depressed when someone mistreats me, but something is different this time; instead of directing my loathing inward, I am now feeling anger flowing outward. 

Then there's the flaming homosexual male supervisor who did a much-appreciated favor for me a few weeks ago, only for him to shit on me a couple of days ago with his arrogant tone of voice and condescending remarks when I politely asked that he sign off on a deal that I had negotiated. Fucking subhuman, do your fucking job and review the fucking papers, instead of blowing me off in my hour of need, you fucking deviant asshat.

I also overheard the literal faggot making jokes about ""cracking his whip"" on employees like me when he was speaking to the other managers. I can't believe the extent to which some human scum will abuse what little power they have over innocents. I feel a fucking rage building.

Fucking subhumans.

They are all plotting against me. They were friendly at first to lure me in, but now they are all turning against me. They want to destroy me.

This is what happens when you're a virgin, manlet incel scum. You have no status, you have no respect, and, if you let your guard down, the tall overlords of your world (even if they're literal faggots) and the empowered dyke sheboon scum will shit down your throat.

533,Incels,"Hello fellow Incels. Recently, I've been occupied with a semi-normie job, unable to NEETcel my way to the grave 'cause bills need to be paid. As a consequence, I've been forced to work with actual Normies to accomplish our goals. None of them are true Chad-tier, but none are Incel either, and they manage to sometimes succeed at Tinder. And if they convinced me of anything, its that being funny is the last thing you need to get laid IRL.

Here's the ""comedy"" I'm subjected to on a daily basis:

-References
-Off-key singing of pop songs
-Burping
-Farting
-Swearing
-Obnoxious voices
-Yelling
-Screaming
-Even more screaming
-Le edgy jokes xD

Basically, every day I have to listen to a poorly written, late season episode of Family Guy FOR 8 HOURS. As an introvert, this is just as draining as the manual labor I actually have to do.  People are annoying as fuck, with most Normie humor unable to rely on anything more than shock value. Yet they still get laid. Because females don't give two shits about how funny you are.

As long as you have ye old LMS, you can get away with saying just about anything in an assholeish manner, and women will think you're the king of banter incarnate. This is the basis of most ""romance"" novels these days: Chad is obnoxious to heroine, heroine gives Chad endless amounts of mindblowing sex. This seems to apply irl as well. Chad can tell Stacey about how he will stalk her into a dark alleyway, and she'll think its the most romantic thing she's ever heard in her life. Chad can imitate the autistic flappings and stammers of Aspergers Adam, and Stacey will laugh too, bearing fuck-me eyes. 

If you can't improve your LMS, there's quite literally no hope for you. You might as well throw in the towel. No amount of careful social observation or clever word play will ever get you laid in your life. Its over.

534,Incels,"Hello guys/gals. 

I found your sub because someone was talking smack about it over at latestagecapitalism. So I was curious and came to check it out.

I can relate to ALOT of the post here, and, I am somewhat kinda like you guys.

I think I might fall between incel and fakecel. Fakecel because when I do have a chance my lack of experience and social retardation prevent me from making it work. And incel, well, I am no chad. 

I was a fat dude all my life up until my mid twenties. I lost weight because the doctor made me, and it got somewhat easier to get attention, but by then I'm out of college and what not so it's not easy infiltrating social circles. Dating sites are full of fake profiles, and it seems you have to have a six pack to get even the ugly girls to reply. Facebook doesn't let you add people non stop because they suspend your account for two weeks. 

This girl who I went to high school with who saw me as one of the geeks who played video games and got stoned with the other geeks, started showing me the time of day at this point. Thing is she was very experienced, and well, who knows how many guys she did. I heard she ditched her boyfriend (they both moved to college together, and she snitched to his parents about his partying, and they came and picked him up, ruining his college career, just so she could be alone to slut it out), just to be a party chick.

Thing is she doesn't have the same body as she did back then, but she acts like she still gots it going on.

Anyways, I did everything I thought I was supposed to do to have a good job and stuff, but the current economy and housing cost make it extremely difficult to advance in life. 

Will I ever meet the one and have kids? I don't know. But honestly, I see how brutal life is, how hard things are, and if I don't have kids, I think I might be okay with it. Not saying its what I want. But so far nothing has worked out. Hell, not even being barely okay seems attainable. 

My mom gives me shit for not having a girlfriend. She thinks it's as easy as going up to a chick and asking her out on a date. Honestly, doing this probably would lead to a few dates here and there (albeit, after randomly talking to over 40 chicks, maybe between 3-5 would give out their number), but it doesn't mean it would work out. 

Last girl I was talking too, the one I mentioned above, was verbally abusive and went off on a tirade of calling me stupid and asking me if I'm stupid simply because I was paying for a candy bar when she was telling me about her lame ass college classes (she went back to school because her kinesiology degree didn't work out for her, yeah, she was one of those fitness chicks, so, you guys can imagine how often she got a pounding). 

I cut her out of my life at that moment.

Maybe my mom thinks girls are the same as they were back in her day? I don't know.

At this point in my life I find myself at some crossroad, and some difficult decisions might lay ahead for me. My career isn't necessarily working out, and who knows what will happen.

this is truly funny. About a week ago I posted a text on r/RedPill. My post was about how looks and genetics determine your success with women, and you know it better than anyone, my friends. So I got around 25 comments which were all about denying looks theory, men these days cannot admit everything is written in your face :D

Furthermore, I have my picture posted in r/AmIUgly ( just to see how I fair in reddit standarts, reddit 6 is a 2), so the guys in the RedPill thread checked the picture out and guess what? They all acted like females, telling me I look good/ok/looks are not your problem because it is too hard for them to swallow the pill or spill the truth about someone's looks.

Few years ago, I knew girls were not into me because of looks but I never openly admitted it. Nowadays if some of my fellas asks or teases me with anything related to my virginity, I just tell em the truth, I cannot get pussy with my face. Period. That gave me a lot of respect from them, because they know that I realise everything and that I am willing to live in this shithole of world alone minding my own business.",1,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=1128, result=""Hey fellas, \n\nthis is truly funny.

537,Incels,"Hi. I am a 17 year old Indian male. I think I might become an incel either older on or maybe I already am one. I was wondering if you guys could try to determine if I will be one.

Ahem...

* My body size: Not buff but not fat or skinny. I am in the middle. 
* Face is kind of chubby. Chin a bit fat. I wear glasses. Might bald soon as well as my family balds soon but atm I have good hair.
* I have never kissed a girl ever in my life or had a girlfriend.
* I am able to maintain a good conversation with girls however. I have a lot of good looking female friends and when I talk I maintain good eye contact and the girls never try to look away or look disgusted so I think I am not that ugly.They also frequently smile at me if it means anything.
* I am a bit awkward. I dont have a phone yet (and im 17 -_-) and I never really hang outside of school. Im not necessarily popular but I can make friends relatively easy as long as I sit near them and can talk with them.
* I peaked in 8th grade. by that I mean, I was pretty confident and had a lot of female friends. I grabbed their tits and asses frequently and the worst thing I got was a girl feeling uncomfortable and telling me to stop. Other than that, they just giggled and did not care.
* However, I had a drastic move after 8th grade and did not quite recover fully. 
* Sometimes  I am pretty insecure and a few times I have had them tell me that I'm ""cute"" but thats it.
* However, I pretty much lost my courage after 8th grade and have not grabbed an ass or tit or made a move on any girl since them.
* I am reallllllyyy insecure. I think this really make it hard for me to ever get a gf or a relationship. However I just cant shake off the feeling that I am just hideous and can never get a girl. 
* But if all comes to worse, my family is relatively wealthy and Saudi Arabian/Indian so I can probably get an arranged marriage. One of my cousins did the same and hes meh looking but got married to this drop dead gorgeous chick and now has 3 kids and they look relatively happy together.

554,Incels,"I found an amazing comment on TRP by /u/puaSenator that I would like to share, it's basically explaining how women cannot love like we do, men are just disposable objects in their eyes and when a girl says ""I love you"", what she is really saying is I love how hot you are, I love how you provide all the money etc. Anyway here is the comment: 

When we say it, we mean women are incapable of the same kind of love men have. We love each other in different ways. Often, men just assume women love us the same way we love them, but that's not true. Our love is entirely different, which causes a lot of men to get really burned.
For instance, men are disposable. When we commit to a woman, we are basically saying you and I are now a team. I am willing to take bullets for you. I will be the last off a sinking ship. I will fight wars for you. I will pay for you. I will do everything in my life dedicated to you and our child.
Women, generally do not have that kind of love for their man. She may care for him a lot, and genuinely feel connected, but she will never have the same type of love we are capable of. She may think she has it, when she's knee deep in lust and infatuation, but she has no problem swinging branches when something better willing to commit comes around. Men tend to stick by their women through thick and thin, just as long as he can trust her and she fulfills her duties as the wife of the man willing to die for her. But for women, she's willing to leave just as long as the relationship hits the rocks and a guy who is objectively better in every way comes offering her more.
For instance, say some stud Hollywood actor came around that you felt a genuinely lustfully infatuated with. You think he also cares for you a lot, and now have the potential to have a wealthy life, with a fun guy connect with, and travel the world! Many women, regardless of what they admit, will be willing to do this. It happens on a daily basis it's almost sickening. Men on the other hand, presented with a similar opportunity are a lot less likely to go branch swinging. They don't want to ruin the relationship with the girl whom they've dedicated their mortality to. There is a reason 75% of divorces are initiated by women. When men divorce, it's generally not because he thinks he can branch swing over something better, but because she's failed to fulfill her role as the wife. She stops caring about him, get's selfish, gains weight, and just generally is no longer his wife.
Hence the reason we teach men the women are not capable of love. It's safer to just understand that too many guys are investing too much of themselves into women who likely wont return the same type of favor. Play it safe, spin plates, and take it slow before getting into a LTR. Don't follow your instinct which is to give her everything and treat her like the woman you're willing to die for. She won't respect you for that. Women are very selfish and they will just take advantage and walk all over you. Today's society's women no longer appreciate and respect male disposability and how difficult it is to always be fighting to be the top 20% both socially and economically. So if they aren't going to pay us that respect, why should we pay them any respect? Many men are choosing to go their own way now because they simply don't see the system as fair -- It's just not worth it.
You may be thinking, ""Yeah but men you don't NEED to act this way. You don't have to jump bullets and go to war for us."" Well, I don't think most women would like it if men stopped being disposable, but that's besides the point. Men want to be this way. We want to be winners and fighters. It's in our genes from hormones to brain structure. It's why so many little boys want to be super heroes. But like I said, times are changing. Men are being told to repress these urges and play by the rules the women are setting up. Feel how they tell you to feel. And it's BS.

684,Incels,"One piece of [unsolicited] advice that we are given is that we, as in, the fuglies and loners, have to ""lower"" our standards.

There is a twofold problem with this however.

First, you cannot change what attracts you. Nor are you a shallow person for having such attractions. If you are not attracted to large, overweight women, then that is entirely your right. Why is it that normies say we shouldn't be entitled to certain body types that we don't look like, yet will tell us that those who we think are not attractive are entitled to be with us?

That leads into my second problem with this wisdom. You'll never see them lowering their own standards and be with people they find unattractive. They'll never be with any of us. And when they reject us they are not told that should not be so picky.

This advice is hypocritical and smacks of double standards.

Attraction in all of its forms is what determines relationships. While this may involve physical attractiveness or personality attractiveness, these are qualities that are determined by the individual.

For example, regardless if they may have a good personality, if I don't find them physically attractive then I won't, and don't have to, date them. On the other hand, I don't care how attractive physically a girl is, if she has a personality I don't like, again I won't and don't have to date her. This doesn't make me shallow or picky. It makes me human. I go for what I like and what I think will make me happy.",1,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=1478, result='One piece of [unsolicited] advice that we are given is that we, as in, the fuglies and loners, have to ""lower"" our standards.\n\nThere is a twofold problem with this however.\n\nFirst, you cannot change what attracts you. Nor are you a shallow person for having such attractions. If you are not attracted to large, overweight women, then that is entirely your right. Why is it that normies say we shouldn\'t be entitled to certain body types that we don\'t look like, yet will tell us that those who we think are not attractive are entitled to be with us?\n\nThat leads into my second problem with this wisdom. You\'ll never see them lowering their own standards and be with people they find unattractive. They\'ll never be with any of us. And when they reject us they are not told that should not be so picky.\n\nThis advice is hypocritical and smacks of double standards.\n\nAttraction in all of its forms is what determines relationships.

705,Incels,"So guys, if you lack confidence to get into and maintain relationships, I have a great solution. It even will help with stuff like job interviews n other shit too. :D

What you gotta do, is join a roleplaying game group! (In person groups only. Online ones lack the social interactions that really make this trick work.)
Join something like D&amp;D or Pathfinder if you want an easy time finding a group, as they are very popular. There are even superhero themed ones and sci-fi ones like starwars, if you aren't into fantasy themes.

See I was a major shy person too, hanged out with the loser crowd in junior high, even got spit on by a boy randomly once. But in high school I joined a D&amp;D group, and it's made all the difference.

You get to practice being other people, characters made up by you, and learn how to act confidently. You can make a beefy barbarian who charges into a fight whenever possible. A sly rogue who's always trying to make deals with people, even in the middle of a fight. Even an arcane master of magic, who controls reality itself with a wave of his hand.

It's all fun stuff, and practicing being these different characters helps you immensely with learning to be more like the ideal, true self you want to be. You don't have to fake being a different person in real life, but having a bit of help learning to act more the way you wish to truly be, isn't a bad thing.

The trick is that you are hanging out with other people at least once a week, all focused on having fun in a game, and this regular social interaction is great for rubbing the rough edges off, and polishing up your nicer facets. Like any diamond in the rough, it will take a bit of work and at least a year or two, but if you stick with it, you will totally notice the difference in your interactions with other people who you want to impress. Joining many different groups with many people will help better, as more people mean faster polishing of your social skills.

Very important though, don't join and try to make a 'sexy' type of character, thinking that this will help you improve faster. The DM is likely to be another dude (assuming most of you are male), and likely one who doesn't want to talk with another dude about sexy things in detail like that. Kinda weird, so avoid that.

The other gamers are there to have fun, and that should be your goal too. Treat this like a free weekly class, and make sure you don't annoy your fellow gamers/colleagues by regularly being late, rude, or hogging all the attention of the guy running things.

Also important to note, just like the rules for work (about never dating a work colleague), if you happen to have a girl or two in your gaming group, don't try to go for it. The time for dating is later, once you have polished your facets. You risk making things weird and having to find another D&amp;D group if you try dating in the group, and that could hurt your progress.

Thanks to D&amp;D, I can now psych myself up for stuff I'm nervous about, like a job interview, and turn on the charm. I just use all the practice I've had with D&amp;D characters, and tell myself that for the next few hours, I'm not just Stillwind11, but the amazing Stillwind11 who can charm the horns off a devil, with max Charisma and persuasion skills! And it works, I can make myself role play a better version of myself, and really succeed in making people think that I'm a natural extrovert, instead of the introvert that I truly am.

So I hope you guys like this idea, and I hope that it can help a few of you out there achieve your dreams one day.

Good luck, and have fun gaming! :D",1,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=3624, result=""So guys, if you lack confidence to get into and maintain relationships, I have a great solution.

Do you ever stop and wonder why guys that tend to be bitter are also ugly? Why do you think their are no bitter chads?

Think logically, whats more likely, some guys bitterness mysteriously turning them genetically ugly, or someone that is genetically ugly slowly turning bitter after constantly getting shat on and getting rejected over something they cant change? i.e height, face, baldness, race etc.

https://theblog.okcupid.com/race-and-attraction-2009-2014-107dcbb4f060

According to the Okay Cupid research, black women have the lowest responses rate of all the races. And what a coincidence black women also happen to be the loudest, angriest most obnoxious women out their. 

Their is three possible scenarios

* 1)  Black women are unattractive and get no attention so they slowly become bitter, angry and resentful
* 2)  Black women are naturally bitter, angry and resentful and hence guys dont find them attractive because of their ""personality"".
* 3)  Black women coincidentally happen to be both the least attractive women and also naturally the angriest and bitter.

Lets knock out scenario 2 first. Their are plenty of guys in relationships with attractive women who get shat on and treated like shit and these chicks have shit personalities, yet guys still flock to these hot women so scenario 2 is not true. And if you believe black women are inherently loud, obnoxious, and bitter due to some genetic predisposition than that makes you racist.

Scenario 3 makes no fucking sense. And if you believe black women are genetically unattractive, inherently loud, obnoxious, and bitter due to some genetic predisposition than that makes you racist on both fronts.

And that leaves scenario 1 being true. Black women are bitter because they are physically unattractive and no one is interested in them. And why you shouldn't be surprised that incels are angry and bitter because they are treated like second class citizens.

714,Incels,"TL;DR: Its not a trope, its a cope.

The base feminist analysis of fat, middle aged sitcom husbands having hot, beautiful wives is the usual objectification claptrap. Women aren't appreciated for their personality, women are treated as asexual creatures, DAE ""Nice Guys"", blah blah blah blah. Because when I want to find some eye candy, I eagerly wait for reruns of Everybody Loves Raymond. I know my first crush was Marge Simpson, wasn't it yours?

I'll admit that there are an usually large number of successful fat asses on TV. You'll also see a few nerds dating way above their looks match in sitcoms, dramas, and cartoons. But to say its only about ""muh objectification"" only makes sense if you hate men. In truth, men have never protested an ugly woman for being on the screen, nor have they marched because a male 9 is shown with a female 9. Sex is usually the last thing on their mind when they're huddled with the family, watching safe, manufactured TV. So why is it important to see attractive women to be with unattractive men?

Well, let's consider actual dating statistics. What would these shows look like if we showed an accurate representation of male-female courting behavior? Well, ""personality theory"" doesn't seem to hold up very well. Money and status are a better indicator, where in both cases women want a man higher than they are. Finally, there's the all important LOOKS, the reason feminists are complaining in the first place. Women are attracted to only 20% of guys, while men are attracted to 50%. If anything, it indicates women are even MORE physical than men, they just don't have the opportunity to express this desire.

So what happens to television if we reflect female desire? Essentially, all women date the bullies, the jocks, the villians, and the douchebags. Every show would look like Sex and the City. Marge Simpson would have a family with Rainier Wolfcastle. Ugly Betty would be dating Zyzz.  Nobody would be pairing with their Looksmatch because women only want to fuck the upper echelon of men. Just as they do in real-life. It is as far from the average American life as possible, where you aren't rewarded for being the hero, kind and caring, or a genius. Nobody wants to see a show where the guy wins because he has a big dick and is kind of a jerk.

This leads to what I think is the real reason for the abundance of hot female characters. Reality is a competition between the sexes, with females aiming to snag the biggest fish in a small pond. Female fantasy only reminds us of the eternal struggle. But in male fantasy, if you're a good enough man/provider, you can **WIN!** It doesn't matter if you're struggling with dating, or beating off your ass at work! If you work hard enough, you can have as good a life as Kevin James or Tim Allen! Big house, hot wife, grateful kids, nice paycheck...all you need to be is understanding and tell a few jokes! See, everything is fine! :) 

But everything ISN'T fine. Women don't actually like their relationships with sub-8 providers. That's why the divorce rate is so high. So yes, these shows do portray an unrealistic vision of American life...but the realistic one is very far from the feminist version, where every woman just wants to date her looksmatch and be respected (but not too respected!). If females had their way, the lookgap would be not only reversed, but far more extreme.

The normal Joe Averages of the world need their sitcoms to justify his life choices, much like he needs sportsball as a proxy for success. ""See, I'm just as hard working as George Lopez! His wife loves him, and she's an 8! My wife must love me too!"" Its the veil to hide the real nastiness of female hypergamy, and how little they care about the average man. In fact, any woman reading this would probably feel deep disgust at me for sympathizing with the ""Nice Guy"" (TM! TM! **TM!!!**) who thinks a provider role is what women want. But what they don't realize is **if being a provider doesn't work, NOTHING FUCKING WILL**. 

If the ugly husband/hot wife trope is nothing more, than it means that personality doesn't actually matter. That LMS - Looks, Money, Status - are everything. That Joe Average's entire life is a lie, a slave work horse to a mistress who doesn't give a shit. A reality where only 1 out of every 5 guys are good enough for her, a place that will **NEVER** fit all the hoards of thirsty men. 

Love becomes a total sham, family is a sham, your country is a sham. Men NEED to believe in the Ugly Husband/Hot Wife trope. Or else **EVERYTHING IS FUCKED!**

All you need is patience and the foresight to see the future with a silver lining. \n\nRight now, technology has enabled the fho\'s to act and live like a bunch of degenerates. We are suffering because it takes a while for society to fully grasp what technology has truly done for us. This is what I like to refer to as ""societal lag"". As rage inducing as the truth about femoids are, the knowledge of the inevitable truth-backlash should ease some tension. Remember gents, time is on our side.

And I saw the true jew Chad! He had a square face, but the sides were straight like an arrow, the jawline’s corner was angular as hell, and his jawline was always strong and visible, no matter how he placed his head you could always see the huge shadow underneath his alpha jawline.

His jewish nose was huge and the shape of a logarithmic function clearly displaying his pure alpha genes, and he had thick good looking hair, tall, and ofc dressed well. He was smooth with girls and it felt somewhat bad to be in a group with him and other womyn.


There was also a disgusting girl there, he must have been the opposite of him, the looks of St Blackopscel manifested in the body of a roastie. Her face was as oval as an egg. She had a doublechin all the time and it was annoying. Her face was unappealing. I dont know what was wrong with it, but she looked unhealthy. She was short too. To be fair not an annoying roastie, she wasnt an asshole but her looks were horrible.

Anyways she got up and she dropped some stuff. Her security pass dropped in front of her and I saw she worked at Randstad, so she is one of those HR sluts that keeps us subhumans down professionally through lookism. In front of me landed an important looking piece of paper.

She forgot to pick up the piece of paper. Being the beta cuck that I am I picked it up went up to her and with a smile told her that she forgot her paper.

Jesus fucking Christ I immediately regretted this afterwards. I relapsed into a beta. This is a HR slut who Chad probably fucks to get a better position. I should have went up to her and tore that paper into shreds in front of her face.

Just a general question, i have been meaning to ask this to you guys. I have a bad f uped mind specially on drugs lately, it changed my mind to focus on irrational thoughts. I cant tell sometimes what is rational to irrational. 

sometimes my autism acts up again. But anyways. 

What is your greatest fear? 

Mine:

1. Not being able to sleep or having sporadic fatal insomnia

2. Dying slowly 

3. My love ones dying

4. Being handicapped

5. Being broke.

The reason i ask is because on the grand scale of things, it does not really add up. 

All i want is to really live my life not fearing this irrational shit . 

Im tired of worrying about my face or worrying if im ugly . 

Its my life! Its my fucking life! Whether im ugly or not, its my life! I would accept that i am not as good looking as fucking chad, but i dont want to be miserable hating people i dont know, becauase theyre entitld and i am not. Fuck them all to be honest . 

I will show them theyre wrong. I dont want this life to cuck me,

**Im ugly and i know it **

I will do what i can to change that, till then , i will toil and sweat and work on things i can change.

I was planning this to be my 100th day post .

This sub changed me.

I would have never done what im doing right now if not for this sub.

Back then, i just think everyone is a chad with just confidence.

The truth is, you cant , if you dont have the looks.


I will work on that. 

4 years in PUA and my success is attributed to me being younger, now im older with failing looks, i cant get the same reaction ,

I was too pussy because deep inside i know that persnality has its limits, that confidance has its limit.

1460 days and all i manage to pull is a 6/10 .

Its all cope, red pill , PUA , its not about that, its about your looks, it mosly that.

I just have to do something,

Right now, 

Im working out

Im saving for a procedure

Im taking every thing to looks max.

Its all i can do.

I stoped coping and started planning .

771,Incels,"You hear it all the time. We feel ""entitled"" to women's bodies. We feel ""entitled"" to women's affection. Our actions and words apparently reveal us to be the most entitled group of people on the planet.

Well, first of all this line of thinking is retarded first and foremost, which I think is due to women misunderstanding the word. Entitled means you think you're owed something. Thus, if you believe you are entitled to something, you do not work for it. At all. You expect it given to you. An example is the right to vote. I expect this to be given to me for no work (yes, I know it used to be earned by military service but that's not the society we live in anymore). If I cannot make it to the polling booth I expect the government to provide transportation. I am *entitled* to the right to vote.

This does not describe 99.9% of men. Men jump through hoops for relationships, sex, and to escape the friendzone. Likewise, incels fight tooth and nail for female affection (those of us that try). Entitled people do not work for what they want. They do not jump through hoops. They expect things to be given to them for existing. 

I'm gonna point out a double standard that turns this on its head and shows women are actually the entitled ones.

People stare at me all the time. It's usually for one of two reasons, because I am ugly or because I am clearly a social freak. Every time I go out in public I am a social pariah, the subject of everyone's entertainment and bemusement. People in cars turn and stare, point, and sometimes holler mean comments if they know me. Customers at work glare at me. Girls stare in a strange mix of pity, (sometimes), indignation at my existence in their space, disgust and fascination.

Do I complain about it? Anywhere but here, no. As cruel and inhuman as it is, it's their right. We live in a free society and when I go out in public I subject myself to this, unfortunately. My only reprieve is when no one is around. It is an unfair plight but it is the only way this society can run.

Women do not give the same courtesy. I don't need to tell anyone here this. Try looking at a girl for longer than 2 seconds and see the reaction you get. Indignation. Anger. Fear. Uncomfortableness. And they aren't content with letting you know that. They shame you too. Even if it isn't to your face, they'll tell people behind your back. ""ScornedStoic is such a fucking creep. He stares at me."" ""Stat away from ScornedStoic. He gives me weird looks."" Interacting with girls at pretty much any level as an incel amplifies your inceldom.

They aren't content with this either. They want to make it criminal. It's harrassment, dontcha know. You're assaulting her. (Yes, that can constitute violating harrassment/assault laws here in Canada.) How dare you, you creep. Maybe she'll get her boytoy to intimidate you.

Every day at work I feel uncomfortable being in the same aisle as a girl, customer or employee. Am I standing too close? Am I pissing her off? Do I say hi, or will that intimidate her? Do I dare look up when she walks by and risk making eye contact? If I don't make eye contact, I'm ignoring her and I'm a jerk. If I make eye contact I'm ""mentally undressing"" her and she'll hate me. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

I want to take a minute to point out the glaring hypocrisy, if any normies are reading. She gets to stare at me and make me as uncomfortable as she wants. No one will blink an eye. She is ENTITLED to make me feel like a rapist, the scum of society, just for daring to share the same space as her. But HOW DARE I look at her? It makes her uncomfortable, so I have to stop!!! I'm such a creep!! She can turn everyone against me for such a transgression. You know what, even if I stared at her for 15 minutes, so fucking what? I have to endure constant abuse for having the audacity to enter a public space. I've accepted that. But you, dressed in your thong clad see through leggings, skintight shirt and strutting your 10 body, you have the right to not have to endure me looking for 5 seconds, even if it was because I found you attractive? That's SUCH a disposition compared to the abuse I face daily that you earn the right to condemn me for it? FUCK YOU.

But remember guys, you're so entitled...
",1,"[Row(annotatorType='document', begin=0, end=4269, result='You hear it all the time. We feel ""entitled"" to women\'s bodies. We feel ""entitled"" to women\'s affection. Our actions and words apparently reveal us to be the most entitled group of people on the planet.\n\nWell, first of all this line of thinking is retarded first and foremost, which I think is due to women misunderstanding the word. Entitled means you think you\'re owed something. Thus, if you believe you are entitled to something, you do not work for it. At all. You expect it given to you. An example is the right to vote. I expect this to be given to me for no work (yes, I know it used to be earned by military service but that\'s not the society we live in anymore). If I cannot make it to the polling booth I expect the government to provide transportation. I am *entitled* to the right to vote.\n\nThis does not describe 99.9% of men. Men jump through hoops for relationships, sex, and to escape the friendzone. Likewise, incels fight tooth and nail for female affection (those of us that try). Entitled people do not work for what they want. They do not jump through hoops. They expect things to be given to them for existing. \n\nI\'m gonna point out a double standard that turns this on its head and shows women are actually the entitled ones.\n\nPeople stare at me all the time. It\'s usually for one of two reasons, because I am ugly or because I am clearly a social freak. Every time I go out in public I am a social pariah, the subject of everyone\'s entertainment and bemusement. People in cars turn and stare, point, and sometimes holler mean comments if they know me. Customers at work glare at me. Girls stare in a strange mix of pity, (sometimes), indignation at my existence in their space, disgust and fascination.\n\nDo I complain about it? Anywhere but here, no. As cruel and inhuman as it is, it\'s their right. We live in a free society and when I go out in public I subject myself to this, unfortunately. My only reprieve is when no one is around. It is an unfair plight but it is the only way this society can run.\n\nWomen do not give the same courtesy. I don\'t need to tell anyone here this. Try looking at a girl for longer than 2 seconds and see the reaction you get. Indignation. Anger. Fear. Uncomfortableness. And they aren\'t content with letting you know that. They shame you too. Even if it isn\'t to your face, they\'ll tell people behind your back. ""ScornedStoic is such a fucking creep. He stares at me."" ""Stat away from ScornedStoic. He gives me weird looks."" Interacting with girls at pretty much any level as an incel amplifies your inceldom.\n\nThey aren\'t content with this either. They want to make it criminal. It\'s harrassment, dontcha know. You\'re assaulting her. (Yes, that can constitute violating harrassment/assault laws here in Canada.) How dare you, you creep. Maybe she\'ll get her boytoy to intimidate you.\n\nEvery day at work I feel uncomfortable being in the same aisle as a girl, customer or employee. Am I standing too close? Am I pissing her off? Do I say hi, or will that intimidate her? Do I dare look up when she walks by and risk making eye contact? If I don\'t make eye contact, I\'m ignoring her and I\'m a jerk. If I make eye contact I\'m ""mentally undressing"" her and she\'ll hate me. Damned if you do, damned if you don\'t.\n\nI want to take a minute to point out the glaring hypocrisy, if any normies are reading. She gets to stare at me and make me as uncomfortable as she wants. No one will blink an eye. She is ENTITLED to make me feel like a rapist, the scum of society, just for daring to share the same space as her. But HOW DARE I look at her?

774,Incels,"Your the worst kind of person. Incels are very real and no amount of personality will help. 

You sir need to ask yourself how society has gotten this bad where YOU a man are not taking up arms with our brothers against the fallacy that society has become a place where women have the sole power in partner matching. 

The world was much better in the past when a man would pick a woman. Approach the patriarch of her family and based on character, intelligence, and ability to support was given the right to marry her virgin empty headed ass. Then that stupid whore was ecstatic she didn't end up a spinster or worse dead by typhoid. 

Now women have destroyed societal norms that men who believe in character and for holding true to their natural instincts are  deemed as misogynistic, Controlling or sociopaths. 

If we don't want them because they've fucked hundreds of guys were slut shamers. 

If we refuse to allow them to control us by their pussies were sociopaths. 

If we look at them because they are dressed like prostitutes were raping them. 

Woman were never supposed to be in charge, they do not understand the strength it takes to walk the line men walk every day. Women are destroying society for men all over America. 

I also blame Men who have allowed woman to raise the children of America with out teaching them the inherently vile and evil disposition in all woman. The importance of being a man and the value of men in society. 

Why do you think a book written thousands of years ago blames all of humanities problems on a single woman who did not have the fucking moral compass to not eat an apple. 

I'm not religious btw but the writing on the wall from thousands of years ago told us to watch women because they are inherently evil. 

Now that men have become pussies allowed woman to control society, child rearing, money, our own fucking sense of right and wrong . Our fellow brothers, our fellow men, are being forced to lead unacceptable lives due to woman becoming the dominate gender in society. They raise our children to be pussies and not be able to determine right from wrong. They are raising our young men to be puppets for them. 

Now it's okay for your wife to sleep with another man to fulfill her illogical and inherently evil desires. 

Now it's okay for women to go on fuck sprees and sleep with multiple guys in a day. 

Now it's okay for women to peg us because it empowers them. So they can have equality of the sexes. 

If your a man reading this and you disagree with me please go get transgender surgery turn your penis inside out and make it a vagina because your not a fucking man. Your the worst piece of human garbage on the planet. You don't deserve to have a dick because your only fucking yourself. 

Men are no longer in charge of our own destinies. For us to live fulfilling lives we are no longer based on our intrinsic personal merits but a long list of qualities that we will never be able to control. Now woman choose who is worthwhile based on genetics and whatever fucked up shit is going on in their completely emotionally and hormonally controlled brains. 

So to you blue pill white knight feminist men to me your worse then women. You're traitors who do not see how they are destroying the world. You defend women because they are soft and fragile? They are not they are calculating inherently morally suspect people who left in charge will eventually lead men into complete subjugation. 

Men are / were chivalrous because women could not stand up for themselves.  But I ask you this where are the women on this sub and in the world who want to stand up for these men, Incels, who are being discriminated against . Treated as mutants and subhumans, and monsters because of their unlucky genetic disposition. Where are women saying these guys deserve happy lives, relationships, companionship, comfort, and affection. 

Those woman don't exist because women only care about themselves . Women will fuck you over the second you are not 100% controlled and subjugated . The second you do not live up to their expectations you are divorced or broken up with. 
This has only happened recently to the extreme because men like you pussy white knights have allowed it. 
 
Men are inherently givers. We work we sweat we provide. Woman are inherently takers. They need and take what they need based on survival instincts instilled from eons of evolution. When the takers get to call all the shots the givers always suffer. We have given everything to women even our manhood.  Unless men change soon life for us will be bleak and meaningless. We will never have a say and always looked at as nothing more then tools for woman to use and subjugate. 

The greatest mistake men have ever done was allow women to tell us what our morals are. 

The second greatest mistake men have done is not pass down our sense of manhood to our boys. We allowed woman to raise a bunch of pussy ass females with dicks. This generation of millennials is the softest weakest generation of men to walk the earth. They have traded in their dicks for iPhones ,
They are sensitive and cry every day. We tell them it's okay when all we're doing is nurturing them into little fucking cucks and beta bucks. 

Men only together can we fight feminism.
Only together we can come together to right the wrongs of the past. 

If we stand together against the heinous treatment of our gender / manhood then and only then we can make sure that society will become stable. Men and woman will be happier . We will then come to understand and appreciate our differences. Not hate each other for them. We will work together towards a better world. Not leave each other the second things get hard.

Never in a time in human history is the world so conflicted. 

So many unhappy people. Terrorism, Brutal Mass killings. Woman leaving men in droves to go live alone. Men living in isolation due to being ashamed of who they are due to judgement of incontrollable genetics. Women and Men are going to suffer much more because things will not get better. 

Men we must work together to bring the balance back to society and if you blue pill pussy white knights  haven't gotten the point yet or are to scared then refer to above transgender surgery.  
You think you'll get the girl you want because your woke? First of all your not woke , your a brainwashed empty headed beta buck. Wait till a Chad fucks your wife and your raising someone else's kid. See how woke you really are. 

Incels and people like me who really understand what society is and where it's going are the true woke. 

You're just a pussy with a dick.

It's because they fit that mask right there. The golden ratio is the ultimate determinant of facial aesthetics (apart from forward grown bone structure and skin quality). The proportions on this face are based on phi (1.61) which is something that humans innately find attractive.  It's fucking over if you don't fit this mask. Most of the ratios are very hard, if not impossible, to correct with surgery too. Especially the eye spacing. You're defintely finished if your eyes are too far apart, or too close together or if your midface is long.

BTW yes they just changed the rules. I’m pretty sure it  hasn't been there the entire time, seeing as they changed the rules around 5 days before I was banned.  I am pretty sure they came up with the concern trolling and sayign they are meanies for if not me, but people like me. 

So I am an /r/incel. I have been an incel into my thirties. I have tried everything to get out. I believe deep deep down in every /r/incel, we wish we were wrong. That somehow we wil find out everythign we believe is wrong.  But I also understand that someone off the internet wil not change our minds in a few comments. That even if we met someone off reddit who wanted to help, that simply meeting someone as an /r/incel is in of itself pretty humiliating. We may not have much but we still have some pride.  I went to r/inceltears because I understood too easily how easy it is to become angry and bitter. I went there to give a face to people they marginalized. 

And I was banned. So I am writing to  the people of /r/inceltears  here because most likley, the people I want to reach are the ones not reading on the subs, but are the people who enjoy hanging out here. 

So to the people of r/inceltears reading this:

Many of you in /r/inceltears talk about the people of /r/incels. You talk about coming in and trying to help people and they dont listen. You talk about questioning their logic. You proudly make posts about how you are banned . You talk about how you are better then /r/incels.

And yet when someone comes into your sub. Does the exact same thing. What happens? You guys change the rules and create the expression concern bullying and ban me.  

I came into your sub and said what you guys were doing was immoral. That spending your time generalizing, mocking and insulting people was wrong. That they themselves were only making things worse. 

I questioned the logic in generalizing /r/incels, I questioned the logic of writing posts that in one stroke said that the /r/incels community were never there for incels yet at the same time calling all incels babies. I questioned comments that said only /r/incels preaches violence while in days previous a comment was heavily upvoted saying all incels should be locked up. 

People from /r/inceltears would say they are better then /r/incels. And if there is an afterlife ; will yiu tell god you deserve to go to heavan because you are better then Elliot Rodger? 

I went in and tried to help/fix you, and just like you guys claim in /r/incels and just like you claim in /r/inceltears you didn't listen? Why is it so hard to understand that  good people dont spend their time pointing out how they are better then and smarter then other people? The difference between a good person and a bad person who helps is a good person, understands they can’t fix someone. They can be there but in the end that person has to choose to change. The bad person sees a person who refuses to change and their ego makes them despise that person. The bad person makes it about their inability to listen to reason . 

And I realize most people on your sub and the moderators on your sub won’t listen. Reddit is not about free speech. Every sub has the right to moderate content as they like and I respect that right. 

The difference between us is I will leave you alone. I will move on with my life. I was banned for 6 days I will not find another sub or create a sub to complain about you. I will not go on /r/incles aside from this point. 

I am sure there are many good people in /r/inceltears who truly feel bad and want to understand and empathize with people in /r/incels. They understand how much lonliness and rejection can twist a person’s soul. 

Maybe those who truly wanted to help incels will move on too. The type of person who understood that you shouldnt hate a person because they refuse their help. 

Its sad, because just as you believe the people in /r/incels are generalizing and illogic and formenting hate ; so are many of you.  Many of /r/inceltears literally cannot understand how what they are doing is wrong.

And that amazes me.  

So good luck. You won’t have me to kick aroudn anymore. You won’t have to downvote me because I said you shouldnt lockup all incels., or that maybe all incels arent middle class okay looking white males. Or even  that maybe posting posts that are 5 minutes old  shows more about your obsession with the sub and need to feel better about yourself, then the post says about incels.
